  "refined_goal": "Build a local-first, adversary-aware PC Sentinel that autonomously triages phishing artifacts and intrusion attempts, detonates suspicious content in sealed containers, and assembles defensible, privacy-preserving attribution dossiers via passive OSINT—without ever “hacking back.” Architecturally, pair a LangChain graph with on-device LLMs (Ollama: Llama 3 8B Instruct Q4_K_M for reasoning, nomic-embed-text for embeddings) to reason over Windows events, email headers, URLs, and binaries. Use Moby/Docker to execute attachments and links in ephemeral sandboxes, yt-dlp/youtube-dl as universal redirect mappers and metadata extractors, and a PowerToys-based agent for system-level capture and just‑in‑time UI. Success = 1) <60s triage per artifact, 2) >90% malicious-detection recall with <2% false positive rate on a diverse corpus, 3) >70% enrichment coverage (WHOIS/DNS/TLS/CDN/redirect graph) and chain-of-custody reports suitable for IR handoff. Why it matters: users get a consumer‑grade “mini SOC” that learns, explains, and contains threats entirely offline.",
  "repository_synergy": "The insight: the most reliable way to analyze weaponized links is to treat the web like a media platform, not a browser session. yt-dlp/youtube-dl—built to withstand brittle anti-bot frontends—house a battle-tested catalog of site extractors and redirect resolvers. Repurposed, they become the perfect safe link expander: no script execution, only structured metadata and redirected endpoints. Marrying that capability with LangChain’s composable agents and an on-device Ollama model turns each suspicious URL or attachment into a deterministic pipeline with probabilistic reasoning layered on top.\n\nThe story: we don’t need cloud SIEMs or heavyweight EDR to protect a personal PC; we need three things: trustworthy isolation, deep-but-local understanding, and gentle user choreography. Moby (Docker) provides hermetic execution sandboxes with precise network and filesystem policies; PowerToys offers the rare, sanctioned path to sit close to Windows UX without kernel gymnastics; React gives us a live threat storyboard; Tabby gives a secure terminal lens into the sandboxed world; and LangChain orchestrates the tools into a single cognitive loop. PayloadsAllTheThings is not a weapon—here it becomes a negative corpus: thousands of payload patterns distilled into detectors, IOC templates, and LLM few-shot examples to spot obfuscation and exfil tricks. javascript-algorithms provides building blocks for fast domain-typo detection, n-gram URL scoring, and deobfuscation heuristics that slot neatly into the pipeline. ImGui becomes an on-screen “panic stripe” overlay and a lightweight HUD that never fights the shell. Manim and freeCodeCamp content fuse into micro‑lessons that play exactly when users hover over a suspect prompt, turning every near-miss into muscle memory.\n\nThe synergy: Ollama keeps the data gravity local, so sensitive headers and events never leave the machine. LangChain wraps Docker operations, yt-dlp extractors, DNS/WHOIS enrichment, and rule engines as tools an LLM agent can call. The non-obvious bridge is using video downloaders as general-purpose, headless, JS-free crawlers to map redirect chains and harvest metadata safely. Another illicit connection is hijacking PowerToys’ plugin model to add a first-class “Quarantine & Detonate” shell verb in Explorer and a low-friction hotkey that routes artifacts into a container in a keystroke. Screenshot-to-code flips roles too: we reconstruct suspect landing pages from screenshots into static HTML/CSS—detonated without live network—to let the LLM and heuristic analyzers reason about intent and visual deception without loading attacker code. Awesome-go acts as a curated substrate to pick high-quality Go libs (pcap, DNS, HTTP fingerprinting) that harden the sandbox sidecars while keeping binaries tiny.\n\nThe innovation: when these pieces click, you get a personal, air-gapped analyst that can 1) safely “open” anything, 2) tell you what it would have done, 3) correlate that story with OS events, and 4) produce a legally sound dossier that helps providers or law enforcement take action. You stop choosing between either clicking a link or ignoring it; you can now open it—in a dead, instrumented universe—and learn from it. That reframes user security from avoidance to reversible exploration, guided by a calm, local AI.",
  "technical_architecture": "Core components and flow:\n\n1) System Capture and UX\n- PowerToys SecurityToy (C#):\n  - Hooks Shell to add “Quarantine & Detonate” for files/links.\n  - Listens to ETW channels (Sysmon if present, Windows Defender events, WMI process start, DNS client events) and forwards normalized events via a local gRPC/Named Pipe to the Orchestrator.\n  - ImGui HUD (C++ sidecar) overlays low-latency banners on suspicious actions and provides a hardware-accelerated, always-on-top panic button to cut network for the active process tree.\n\n2) Orchestrator (Python, LangChain)\n- Tools:\n  - LinkExpander: wraps yt-dlp/youtube-dl extractors to fetch URL metadata, follow redirects, and harvest canonical URLs, thumbnails, and manifests without JS execution.\n  - DetonationManager: calls Docker Engine API (Moby) to launch ephemeral sandboxes:\n    - Profile A (attachments): Windows container or Linux Wine sandbox with read-only mount, no host network, egress limited to DNS sink and HTTP mirror; file activity, process tree, and DNS/HTTP captured via sidecar.\n    - Profile B (links): headless browser with disabled JS timers and network prefetch, HAR capture, or a pure curl-based fetcher with CSP injection.\n  - OSINT Enricher (passive): DNS A/AAAA/CNAME/MX, RDAP/WHOIS (rate-limited), TLS JA3/ALPN, CDN/provider mapping, Geo-approx region, and historical passive DNS if available from local cache.\n  - Payload Detector: rule engine seeded from PayloadsAllTheThings patterns converted into:\n    - YARA (strings/regex),\n    - simple Suricata-like signatures for pcap sidecar,\n    - LLM few-shot examples to spot semantic variants.\n  - Deobfuscator: uses javascript-algorithms for tokenization, frequency and n-gram scoring, AST walking to flag eval/btoa/atob chains; provides a reduced, human-readable version to the LLM.\n- LLM Layer (Ollama, localhost:11434):\n  - llama3:8b-instruct Q4_K_M for reasoning over multi-modal metadata, event sequences, and detection outputs.\n  - nomic-embed-text for vectorizing IOCs, email headers, and behavioral snippets into a local FAISS index for cross-case correlation.\n- Memory and Storage:\n  - SQLite + Parquet for event streams and artifacts, signed with chain-of-custody hashes.\n  - Vector store (FAISS) for IOC dedup and similarity search.\n\n3) Analyst Interfaces\n- React dashboard (WebSocket SSE): live timeline (process trees, DNS, redirects), risk scores, and a one-click export of an evidence bundle (PDF plus JSON, hashes, pcap, YARA hits, OSINT summary).\n- Tabby plugin (TypeScript): a constrained terminal into the active sandbox (docker exec) with readonly files and whitelisted commands, for advanced triage.\n- Micro-learning: Manim-generated clips embedded in the React UI, triggered by specific detection rationales; optional freeCodeCamp links for deeper self-study.\n\nAPIs and protocols:\n- Docker Engine REST (AF_UNIX/Named Pipe) with audited profiles.\n- Ollama HTTP for LLM and embedding endpoints; batching and streaming responses reduce latency.\n- gRPC/Named Pipes between SecurityToy and Orchestrator to avoid exposing localhost ports.\n\nKey challenges and solutions:\n- Safe link expansion: use yt-dlp extraction pipelines in a network-locked container; disable external players and JS; treat HTML as data.\n- Performance: cache DNS/WHOIS; quantize models; pre-spawn warm sandboxes; incremental embeddings; stream LLM tokens for fast first answers.\n- False positives: calibrate a hybrid score (rules + LLM + behavior). Require consensus or strong signals to auto-quarantine; otherwise prompt the user via HUD.\n- Evidence integrity: immutable artifact store with SHA-256 chains; time-signed detonation logs.\n- Legal/ethical bounds: no active scanning beyond target resources; attribution framed as enrichment (infrastructure, patterns, not people).",
  "expected_impact": "Use cases:\n1) Invoice.docm lands in Downloads: user hits Quarantine & Detonate. The system opens it in a Windows container, logs macro execution attempts, captures spawned PowerShell commands, and correlates DNS beacons. The LLM explains the likely intent, the rule engine flags known obfuscation, and the dossier is ready for reporting.\n2) Discord DM link: LinkExpander resolves a chain of URL shorteners to a fast-flux domain. No JS is executed. DNS/WHOIS shows a just-registered domain via a bulletproof hoster; risk crosses threshold and the HUD intercepts with a safe preview and a Manim 45-second lesson on shortener abuse.\n3) USB drop scenario: autorun.inf-like behavior triggers ETW alerts. The orchestrator detaches autorun, fingerprints binaries with YARA, detonates offline, and shows a process tree animation; user learns without exposure.\n4) Ransomware pre-execution: multiple suspicious registry writes + VSS shadow deletion attempt detected within 5s; the HUD panic button cuts egress and suspends process trees; the system compiles a one-click evidence package for IR.\n5) Browser extension impersonation site: screenshot-to-code reconstructs the page offline; LLM compares visual cues (typo brand, green padlock misuse) and warns with a confidence-backed explanation and side-by-side diff.\n6) Small business owner workflow: weekly digest summarizes incidents, recurring IOCs, and recommended email rules; micro-lessons adapt to the user’s mistakes.\n7) Blue-team lite: Tabby terminal into the sandbox allows a power user to run pre-canned netstat/ls/strings flows without risking host integrity.\n\nScalability and extensibility:\n- Stateless sandboxes scale horizontally; caches make enrichment cheap.\n- New rules drop-in via Payloads corpus; new Ollama models can be swapped without cloud.\n\nLimitations and mitigations:\n- True human attribution is out of scope; we provide infrastructure-level enrichment only.\n- Container escapes are rare but non-zero; use gVisor/Hyper-V isolation profiles and read-only mounts.\n- Local LLMs can hallucinate; pair with deterministic signals and calibrated thresholds.\n- WHOIS rate limits; implement backoff and local mirrors, never brute force.",
  "innovation_analysis": "Innovation score: 8.5/10. The repurposing of yt-dlp as a safe, JS-free redirect mapper and metadata harvester, the PowerToys-based just‑in‑time UX, and turning PayloadsAllTheThings into a defensive corpus create a distinctive, local-first “mini SOC” that’s practical and novel.\n\nNext steps (2-week sprint):\n- MVP: PowerToys context verb, Docker detonation profile, yt-dlp expander, Ollama reasoning chain, React timeline.\n- Add ETW ingestion and evidence bundling; integrate FAISS embeddings for IOC dedup.\n\nKey metrics:\n- Mean triage latency (<60s), detection recall/precision on a seeded corpus, enrichment coverage %, user interruption rate, and dossier completeness score.\n\nEssential tools:\n- Windows ETW/Sysmon, Docker Engine API, Ollama models (llama3, nomic-embed-text), LangChain, YARA, React/Tabby, ImGui, and curated patterns from PayloadsAllTheThings.",

Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.\n* **Component-Based:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.\n* **Learn Once, Write Anywhere:** We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) and power mobile apps using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).\n\n[Learn how to use React in your project](https://react.dev/learn).\n\n## Installation\n\nReact has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and **you can use as little or as much React as you need**:\n",

This repository began as a personal project by the author of [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/) for the purpose of animating those videos, with video-specific code available [here](https://github.com/3b1b/videos).  In 2020 a group of developers forked it into what is now the [community edition](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/), with a goal of being more stable, better tested, quicker to respond to community contributions, and all around friendlier to get started with. See [this page](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/faq/installation.html#different-versions) for more details.\n\n## Installation\n> [!Warning]\n> **WARNING:** These instructions are for ManimGL _only_.
