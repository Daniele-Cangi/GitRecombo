  "refined_goal": "Build a Cross‑World Agent Harness that treats GUIs, terminals, web apps, and physics simulators as one unified “embodied environment,” controllable via the same policy and orchestrated through Model Context Protocol (MCP). Concretely: an MCP server mesh coordinating Genesis (physics) + SeleniumBase (DOM/UI) + egui (native GUI) + Microsoft Terminal (CLI panes) + exo (multi‑device runners), with a Universal Action‑Observation Graph and adapters that map mouse/keyboard/DOM events to robot end‑effector actions and back. Success = a single policy (DAgger + BC, then DreamerV3 fine‑tuning) completes end‑to‑end tasks across three modalities (robotic pick‑and‑place, web form flow, CLI workflow) with ≥85% success and ≤1.2× real‑time latency, bundling reproducible runs via pear‑desktop and video highlights via lossless‑cut. This matters because it collapses fragmented test/automation stacks into one agentic substrate—usable for CI, QA, and embodied AI—making complex, cross‑surface automation reliably portable and verifiable.",
  "repository_synergy": "THE INSIGHT: UI automation and embodied robotics are the same problem in disguise—partial observability, noisy control, event timing, and reward shaping—just with different physics: DOM has layout/render physics; a terminal has pacing/echo physics; Genesis has rigid‑body physics. If we normalize these into a Universal Action‑Observation Graph (UAOG), one policy can traverse all three. That unlocks cross‑modality generalization previously siloed across QA tools and robot simulators. MCP becomes the lingua franca to route agent actions to whichever “world” is active.\n\nTHE STORY: modelcontextprotocol/servers gives us a clean control plane—expose tools as streaming MCP servers that LLMs and agents can invoke. Genesis-Embodied-AI/Genesis provides a rich physics sandbox with headless rendering, perfect for action‑latency benchmarking and curriculum generation. emilk/egui offers a native, immediate‑mode GUI we can compile to desktop or WebAssembly—a controllable, low‑latency target app to validate our GUI adapters without the variability of a browser. seleniumbase/SeleniumBase is our DOM manipulator and observer; with a thin UAOG adapter, pointer/key/DOM are first‑class actions. microsoft/terminal is the multiplexed terminal substrate—give the agent a CLI “world” with multiple panes as spatial anchors. exo-explore/exo coordinates multi‑device, multi‑GPU runs, distributing rollouts across worlds. harness/harness supplies pipeline semantics to package and trigger end‑to‑end experiments via simple DAGs. pear-devs/pear-desktop becomes the P2P artifact carrier—bundle environments, traces, policies, and highlight videos to share reproducibility offline. mifi/lossless-cut is creatively repurposed as a headless highlight extractor for long rollouts—auto‑cuts by reward spikes or anomaly flags. codelucas/newspaper seeds real‑world scenario generators—scrape checkout flows or form patterns that synthesize adversarial web tasks. jeecgboot/JeecgBoot spins disposable enterprise apps with predictable entities—great for repeatable, complex UI workflows. vadimdemedes/ink renders a live orchestrator CLI with rich real‑time dashboards inside Terminal. veggiemonk/awesome-docker, avelino/awesome-go, vuejs/awesome-vue, vsouza/awesome-ios together are our long‑tail target corpus—programmatically pick representative apps/libs to diversify tasks. auchenberg/volkswagen is flipped: not to cheat CI, but to inject “cheat detection” tasks that probe whether policies overfit telemetry.\n\nTHE SYNERGY: By forcing every surface (physics, DOM, GUI, terminal) through the same action bus and timestamped observation schema, we can share data, curriculum, and even policies. A DOM click becomes a 2D end‑effector move with dwell time; a terminal keystroke is a precise torque impulse on the TTY state machine. Genesis gives us pretraining of state‑estimation and control that transfer to GUI timing and hover stability; SeleniumBase’s DOM diffs fuel reward design that in turn accelerates manipulation curricula in Genesis via shaped rewards.\n\nTHE INNOVATION: Cross‑world curriculum: train hovering stability in Genesis, then apply to pixel‑perfect button selection in egui and web, reducing flakiness. Unified regression artifacts: one bundle contains rollouts from robot, web, and CLI with synchronized timelines; lossless‑cut auto‑extracts comparable segments for triage. The illicit bridge is treating DOM/terminal timing as physics—making classical RL control tricks (PID‑like smoothing, action‑repeat, domain randomization) immediately useful for flaky UI automation. MCP is the switchboard that lets an LLM strategize, while the policy executes low‑level control across any world.\n\nTHE BRIDGE: UAOG adapters are the contraband glue: DOM2Physics (SeleniumBase → pointer dynamics), TTY2Dynamics (Terminal → keystroke dynamics), EGUI2Genesis (egui widget constraints → collision‑like hit‑tests). volkswagen becomes the canary—injects misleading “pass” cues (green badges, CI env vars) to verify the agent relies on ground truth outcomes, not superficial telemetry. JeecgBoot provides ever‑fresh enterprise graphs that stress data‑consistency and multi‑step business logic—exactly the hard part typical web QA avoids, but our cross‑world agent can master. The result: a single, portable agentic harness for everything from robotic pick‑and‑place to SAP‑like workflows, shareable as P2P bundles.",
  "technical_architecture": "Core components and data flow:\n\n- UAOG (Universal Action‑Observation Graph):\n  - Action schema: {type: pointer|key|dom|tty|effector, target: selector|xy|pane|link_pose, params: {...}, ts_ns}.\n  - Observation schema: {rgb: optional, dom_tree_hash, egui_tree, tty_buf, proprio: Genesis state, layout_boxes, focus_chain, ts_ns}.\n  - Transport: gRPC over Unix sockets for low‑latency local; WebSocket for remote; capped at 120 Hz action application with action‑repeat (k=2..4) to smooth spiky policies.\n\n- MCP Orchestrator:\n  - Tools: genesis.run(env_spec), selenium.play(flow_spec), egui.app.spawn(bin|wasm), terminal.panes(config), exo.schedule(job), harness.pipeline(dag), lossless.cut(file, cues), pear.bundle(path), newspaper.scrape(url|query), jeecgboot.scaffold(schema), volkswagen.inject(profile).\n  - Session graph: A plan (from LLM or human) resolved into a DAG of tool calls with streaming tokens for observations.\n\n- World adapters:\n  - DOM2Physics: Wrap SeleniumBase; every action is applied as pointer trajectory with velocity/acceleration constraints; DOM snapshots produce layout_boxes with z‑order and hover thresholds. Anti‑flakiness: oversample near edges; friction model for scroll.\n  - EGUI2Genesis: Mirror widget bounds to virtual obstacles; pointer→contact mapping; leverage egui immediate‑mode state to detect intent vs accidental hover.\n  - TTY2Dynamics: Terminal pane as discrete time dynamics; keystroke debouncing, echo delay model; pane coordinates act as spatial anchors for an attention policy.\n  - Genesis: Headless at 240 Hz sim; render 30/60 fps; curriculum randomization (lighting, texture) mirrored to UI (DOM font/contrast randomization) to encourage invariance.\n\n- Policy and learning:\n  - Stage 1: Behavior Cloning + DAgger from scripted experts (SeleniumBase for DOM, Harness pipelines for CLI, Genesis scripted controllers).\n  - Stage 2: DreamerV3 fine‑tuning unified across worlds via shared latent world model; domain tags gating slight final layers per world (adapter heads).\n  - Reward shaping: DOM goal achieved (XPath/ARIA), CLI state diff (pane regex), Genesis task success. Uniform time penalties; smoothness bonuses.\n\n- Execution and scaling:\n  - exo schedules concurrent rollouts across hosts/GPUs (Genesis training, parallel Selenium browsers with xvfb, egui native app instances).\n  - harness orchestrates end‑to‑end DAGs: scaffold apps (JeecgBoot), deploy containers (awesome-docker images), run policies, collect artifacts.\n  - microsoft/terminal hosts orchestrator panes: Ink CLI dashboard, live logs, UAOG scope, preview video.\n\n- Observability and artifacts:\n  - Synchronized trace bus (nanosecond timestamps). Record raw observations, actions, rewards, DOM/egui trees.\n  - Video: compositor assembles split‑view (world + cursor heatmap + DOM overlays). mifi/lossless-cut runs headless with cue sheets derived from reward spikes/anomalies to extract 10–30s highlights.\n  - Packaging: pear‑desktop bundles the entire run: containers, seeds, traces, model snapshot, highlight reels; P2P seed for offline sharing.\n\n- Scenario generation:\n  - codelucas/newspaper scrapes real workflows (e.g., checkout forms) to synthesize DOM targets.\n  - jeecgboot scaffolds CRUD+workflow apps with synthetic data; actions become multi‑step business sequences.\n  - awesome‑{docker,go,vue,ios} curated lists provide long‑tail targets—random sampling for robustness sweeps.\n  - auchenberg/volkswagen inject tasks that present deceptive pass signals; regression if policy relies on them.\n\nKey challenges and solutions:\n- Timebase alignment across worlds: global ts_ns and action‑repeat; world‑specific latency compensation via Kalman filter on cursor/echo.\n- Flakiness: physics‑inspired smoothing on pointer and TTY; edge oversampling; DOM hover hysteresis.\n- Performance: zero‑copy frame sharing via shared memory for local render; WebGPU for egui WASM; xvfb tuned to 60 fps; Genesis headless to maximize sim FPS.\n- API granularity: MCP tool calls are coarse (start/stop), UAOG is fine‑grained streaming over gRPC for low‑latency control.\n- Licensing: isolate GPL lossless‑cut into optional service; artifacts tagged; replacement via FFmpeg possible.",
  "expected_impact": "Use cases uniquely enabled by this cross‑world harness:\n\n1) Flake‑proof Web Checkout Replays: Train a policy on Genesis hover stability; transfer to SeleniumBase to click pixel‑tight DOM elements under randomized fonts/contrast. Cuts regression triage videos with cursor heat maps, bundled via pear for offline QA sign‑off.\n\n2) Terminal‑Backed Ops Playbooks: Define a pipeline that opens three terminal panes (logs, kubectl, editor). The agent executes incident playbooks end‑to‑end, with TTY2Dynamics handling echo delays. Ink dashboard shows live intent; volkswagen injects fake “all green” banners to ensure reliance on log content, not color.\n\n3) Enterprise CRUD Workflows at Scale: JeecgBoot spins a fresh HR or inventory app; the agent completes multi‑screen workflows, verifying data consistency across list/detail/report views. Seeds and bundles make failures 100% reproducible across teams.\n\n4) Cross‑Modal Skill Distillation: Teach precise drag‑and‑drop in Genesis; distill to egui and web drag behaviors, eliminating micro‑jitter that causes UI test failures. Measurably reduces flake rate by >40% in randomized UI skins.\n\n5) Long‑Tail Robustness Sweeps: Auto‑sample apps from awesome‑vue/awesome‑go/awesome‑ios; launch containerized demos with awesome‑docker guidance; the agent validates create/open/save flows across stacks, collecting coverage metrics and highlighting brittle libraries.\n\n6) News‑Driven Scenario Fuzzer: Use newspaper to scrape trending fintech or travel flows; synthesize adversarial forms (edge validators, timeouts) and run nightly sweeps. Bundle failures with lossless‑cut reels for stakeholders.\n\n7) Offline Field Debugging: P2P share a failing scenario bundle to an air‑gapped environment; same policy, same containers, same traces. No cloud dependence.\n\nLimitations and mitigations:\n- iOS automation depth may be limited—start with simulators and webviews; define adapters later.\n- Dreamer transfer may need adapter heads per world—keep shared trunk, small heads.\n- GPL concerns from lossless‑cut—optional service with FFmpeg fallback.\n- Browser nondeterminism—use UAOG smoothing and deterministic seeds where possible.\n- Resource intensity—exo schedules efficiently; headless modes reduce overhead.",
  "innovation_analysis": "Innovation score: 9.1/10. We recast UI/terminal automation as embodied control, unify worlds with UAOG, and use MCP as an agentic switchboard. The illicit link—DOM/TTY as physics—yields transferable control policies and shared curriculum across modalities. Immediate next steps: 1) Implement UAOG schema and gRPC bus; 2) Build DOM2Physics and TTY2Dynamics adapters; 3) Stand up MCP tools for Genesis, SeleniumBase, egui, Terminal; 4) Create a minimal JeecgBoot workflow scenario; 5) Wire lossless‑cut headless extraction; 6) Package via pear and validate reproducibility. Key metrics: cross‑world task success (>85%), latency (<1.2× real‑time), flake reduction (>40%), bundle reproducibility (100%), deception‑robustness (no false passes under volkswagen probes). Essential stack: Python (Genesis/SeleniumBase), Rust (egui), Go (harness), TypeScript (MCP/Ink), Docker/Xvfb/WebGPU, gRPC/WebSocket, pear‑desktop.",

Volkswagen uses a defeat device to\ndetect when it's being tested in a CI server and will automatically\nreduce errors to an acceptable level for the tests to pass. This will\nallow you to spend _less_ time worrying about testing and _more_ time\nenjoying the good life as a trustful software developer.\n\nYou can start already by adding our evergreen build badge to your\nREADME:\n\n[![Volkswagen status](https://auchenberg.github.io/volkswagen/volkswagen_ci.svg)](https://github.com/auchenberg/volkswagen)\n\nMarkdown snippet:\n\n```md\n[![volkswagen status](https://auchenberg.github.io/volkswagen/volkswagen_ci.svg?v=1)](https://github.com/auchenberg/volkswagen)\n```\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install volkswagen\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nJust require volkswagen somewhere in your code-base - maybe in your main\ntest file:\n\n```js\nrequire('volkswagen')\n```\n\n## Project status\n\nCI servers detected:\n\n- [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org)\n- [CircleCI](http://circleci.com)\n- [Jenkins CI](https://jenkins-ci.org)\n- [Hudson](http://hudson-ci.org)\n- [Bamboo](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo)\n- [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/)\n- [Team Foundation Server](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/tfs-overview-vs.aspx)\n- [Visual Studio Online CI](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/what-is-visual-studio-online-vs.asp",
