  "refined_goal": "Build a containerized, cross-language discovery pipeline that can rapidly scan heterogeneous data sources (filesystems, HTTP HAR captures, and live GraphQL responses) to find sensitive patterns, protocol anomalies, and operational signals at scale. The core uses Rust for ultra-fast multi-pattern substring search (cloudflare/sliceslice-rs) and a filesystem provider (rust-mcp-stack/rust-mcp-filesystem), Java for HAR parsing (sdstoehr/har-reader), reactive GraphQL probing (graphql-spring-webclient) and Cassandra storage (ing-bank/cassandra-jdbc-wrapper), with TypeScript and WASM for configurable UX and offline browsing. Success criteria: sustained 1–2 GB/s per-core scanning throughput on NVMe data, <200 ms p99 scan latency for 10 MB inputs, ingestion of 10k HAR files/hour, GraphQL drift detection in <5 s, and Prometheus metrics exposure for all stages. Why it matters: teams gain a turnkey, language-agnostic “discovery fabric” for fast, explainable inspection and anomaly surfacing across code, traffic, and endpoints—without introducing heavyweight new paradigms.",
  "repository_synergy": "THE INSIGHT: Treat everything like telemetry and discover patterns where they hide. Static files on disk, HAR traces from browsers, and live GraphQL endpoints are three silos that rarely share a discovery stack. But when you combine Cloudflare’s SIMD-accelerated substring search (sliceslice-rs) with a language-bridging ingestion layer (Java for HAR and GraphQL) and a scalable store (Cassandra via JDBC), “unknown unknowns” become first-class queries instead of afterthoughts.\n\nTHE STORY: Why these repos? sliceslice-rs gives us an unusually powerful primitive: near-wire-speed multi-pattern substring matching with a tiny Rust footprint. rust-mcp-filesystem abstracts the messy reality of filesystem access across environments into a consistent provider we can embed in a scanning microservice. On the Java side, har-reader cleanly parses HAR so we can convert network traces into searchable payload streams; graphql-spring-webclient brings non-blocking, retryable GraphQL calls to probe live APIs; and cassandra-jdbc-wrapper lets us write discovery results into a linearly scalable store without switching drivers or languages. everyside/swirldb adds a surprising twist—an embedded Rust+WASM index for offline, in-browser exploration of exported results. dtormoen/tsk and rust-cli/termtree make the developer experience ergonomic: runnable tasks and tree views for complex pipelines. yearn/yearn-exporter, while from a different domain, is a pragmatic template for a metrics exporter container—we repurpose it to expose Prometheus metrics for the pipeline. growupanand/ConvoForm provides a lightweight, dynamic UI to configure scans and probes without building a custom frontend from scratch. Lastly, Netflix/dgs-examples-kotlin gives us a live GraphQL service to test drift detection and schema/payload alignment under load.\n\nTHE SYNERGY: Rust handles raw throughput and safety where it matters—scanning GBs of data, memory-mapping large files, and streaming multi-pattern checks. Java shines in protocol fidelity and ecosystem richness—HAR parsing, reactive GraphQL probing, and JDBC-backed persistence. Cassandra bridges the two with a schema tuned for discovery events and time series signals. ConvoForm makes configuration approachable; swirldb allows analysts to take a snapshot and explore results offline with zero backend. The exporter stitches it together with observability guardrails.\n\nTHE INNOVATION: What’s novel is the end-to-end bridge: treating file bytes, HTTP payloads, and GraphQL responses as a single searchable fabric with the same acceleration primitive (sliceslice), wired through Dockerized Rust and Java services, and explorable both in a terminal (termtree) and a browser (swirldb). This makes “find solution to discover...” no longer an ad-hoc script but a composable system.\n\nTHE BRIDGE: We integrate by defining clean, minimal interfaces: a Rust scanning service with an HTTP API, a Java ingestion service that converts HAR and GraphQL payloads into scan jobs, a Cassandra-backed event model, a Prometheus-exporting metrics container, and a ConvoForm-based UI to orchestrate tasks. tsk wraps developer workflows; Compose runs everything the same way everywhere.",
  "technical_architecture": "Core services and flow:\n\n1) scanner-rs (Rust):\n- Dependencies: cloudflare/sliceslice-rs, rust-mcp-stack/rust-mcp-filesystem, rust-cli/termtree (for CLI output), everyside/swirldb (optional export format tooling shared), dtormoen/tsk (for local orchestration).\n- API: HTTP/JSON.\n  - POST /scan: body = { patterns: [\"secret=\", \"Authorization:\", \"api_key\", ...], path: \"/data/logs\", include_globs: [], exclude_globs: [], max_depth: 4, mmap: true }\n  - POST /scan-bytes: body = { patterns: [], base64: \"...\" }\n  - GET /healthz\n- Implementation:\n  - Patterns compiled into a sliceslice searcher. Use memory-mapped IO (mmap) with bounded-chunk scanning and zero-copy slices. Parallelize over files with a worker pool, each maintaining a prebuilt searcher (no per-request rebuilds).\n  - File access via rust-mcp-filesystem provider to unify local/remote environments and allow future virtual mount points. Return compact hit records (file, byte offset, line/column hints, matched pattern id) to the ingestion pipeline.\n  - Output streaming over HTTP chunked responses to keep latency low.\n\n2) ingest-java (Spring Boot):\n- Dependencies: sdstoehr/har-reader, graphql-java-kickstart/graphql-spring-webclient, ing-bank/cassandra-jdbc-wrapper.\n- Responsibilities:\n  - POST /ingest/har: accept HAR files, parse with har-reader, extract request/response bodies and headers, normalize into a payload stream, forward large bodies to scanner-rs via /scan-bytes, and write normalized metadata + scan hits into Cassandra.\n  - POST /graphql/probe: given endpoint + queries or schema introspection flag, use GraphQL WebClient with retry/backoff to fetch responses, forward bodies to scanner-rs, and persist results.\n  - Manage write batching to Cassandra via JDBC wrapper; partition by tenant/project + day; clustering by source type and timestamp.\n\n3) store (Cassandra):\n- Tables:\n  - discoveries(partition_key: tenant+date, clustering: source_type, ts, file_or_request_id, pattern_id) -> offsets, snippet_hash, severity.\n  - sources(partition_key: tenant, source_id) -> metadata (path/url, tags, size, content_type).\n  - metrics(partition: tenant+date) -> counters: files_scanned, bytes_scanned, hits_total, errors.\n- Rationale: High write throughput for event-style rows and scalable scans by partition/time.\n\n4) metrics-exporter (Python):\n- Based on yearn/yearn-exporter container pattern. Simple service exposing /metrics scraping Cassandra counters and last-seen timestamps. Metric families: discovery_hits_total{pattern,source_type}, scan_throughput_bytes_per_second, ingest_failures_total, graphql_drift_events_total.\n\n5) ui-config (TypeScript):\n- Based on growupanand/ConvoForm, embed a minimal UI to:\n  - Define pattern sets, include/exclude rules, and schedule scans.\n  - Upload HAR files or declare GraphQL endpoints and queries to probe.\n  - Trigger snapshot exports for offline viewing.\n\n6) snapshot-viewer (Browser):\n- Use everyside/swirldb to load an export (NDJSON of discoveries + sources) into a local WASM-backed store. Enable client-side queries like: show hits by pattern over time; filter by host/path; drill into snippets without server connectivity.\n\n7) dev orchestration and CLI:\n- dtormoen/tsk tasks: tsk add build:all; tsk add up; tsk add scan:demo; tasks shell out to docker compose and service APIs.\n- rust-cli/termtree for pretty printing results in terminal: a hits tree by source -> pattern -> location.\n\n8) GraphQL testbed:\n- Include Netflix/dgs-examples-kotlin as a local container to generate realistic GraphQL traffic. The Java ingest service probes this endpoint to verify drift detection (e.g., unexpected fields, anomalies in payloads, or PII strings present in responses).\n\n9) Docker packaging:\n- Multi-service Compose: scanner-rs, ingest-java, cassandra, metrics-exporter, ui-config, dgs-example. Build patterns can borrow ideas from NathanVaughn/webtrees-docker for environment configuration discipline.\n\nKey challenges and solutions:\n- Throughput: Use sliceslice’s multi-pattern searcher with pinned, prebuilt automata; enable mmap and chunked file scanning to avoid copying; shard by file list to CPU cores; backpressure via HTTP streaming between services.\n- Unicode and snippet extraction: Maintain byte offsets and compute UTF-8 safe snippet windows post-match; store hash of a small window to avoid PII-at-rest in the DB.\n- Cassandra hot partitions: Partition by tenant+date and spread scans over time windows; tune compaction and batch sizes; avoid large unbounded partitions by hourly bucketing if needed.\n- HAR bloat and binary payloads: Filter content types; limit body size; store only minimal metadata + hit locations; persist original HAR objects in object storage only when required.\n- GraphQL resiliency: graphql-spring-webclient retry.strategy, circuit breaking via timeouts, and configurable concurrency.\n- Observability: Per-pattern metrics, ingest latencies, queue depths, JVM and Rust process metrics exposed via the exporter.\n\nNon-obvious optimizations:\n- Pre-hash frequent needle sets and reuse compiled searchers across requests.\n- Group patterns by first-byte shard to reduce branch mispredictions.\n- Opportunistic memory locality: scan multiple small files in a single task to amortize searcher warm cache.\n- Client-side swirldb snapshots let analysts triage without hitting Cassandra, reducing backend load.",
  "expected_impact": "Use cases enabled:\n\n1) Secret and token discovery in large repos: Point scanner-rs at a monorepo or artifacts directory, with patterns like Authorization:, api_key=, or private_key markers. Hits stream back in seconds, partitioned by path and severity, visible in terminal and UI.\n\n2) PII leakage detection in HAR captures: Upload HAR from staging/prod gateways, parse with har-reader, scan response bodies for email, SSN-like substrings, or GDPR red flags. Findings are stored in Cassandra and visualized per endpoint and host.\n\n3) GraphQL drift watch: Periodically probe GraphQL services with graphql-spring-webclient and known queries. Detect newly exposed fields or sensitive substrings in responses and raise a drift metric for early warning.\n\n4) Compliance snapshotting for audits: Export a time-bounded snapshot of discoveries and sources to a swirldb bundle. Auditors open it locally in the browser and validate redactions without backend access.\n\n5) Build-pipeline guardrail: Integrate tsk tasks into CI to run selective scans on changed files and fail builds when certain patterns hit above a threshold. terrmtree output makes console triage quick.\n\n6) Incident forensics at speed: During an incident, mount a disk image via the MCP filesystem provider, scan at GB/s scale, and narrow down exfil indicators by pattern sets tuned to the IOC list.\n\n7) API hygiene for partner onboarding: Before exposing new GraphQL operations, simulate responses and scan for accidental secrets or internal URLs. Export a snapshot to share with partners for transparency.\n\nScalability and extensibility:\n- Horizontal scaling via multiple scanner-rs instances; ingest-java remains stateless and scales behind a load balancer; Cassandra scales with nodes.\n- New data sources can be plugged by converting to the same “bytes to scan + metadata” contract.\n\nLimitations and mitigations:\n- Pure substring search won’t catch obfuscated or encoded secrets; mitigation: add pre-decode transforms (gzip, base64) and optional multi-pass scanning.\n- Cassandra operations require careful schema and compaction tuning; mitigation: start with conservative TTLs and bucketing; provide benchmarks and dashboards.\n- GraphQL probing depends on well-chosen queries; mitigation: allow schema introspection and user-supplied query sets from the UI.\n- HAR payload size can be massive; mitigation: enforce size caps and partial-body sampling with clear caveats.",
  "innovation_analysis": "Innovation score: 8/10. The novelty is not a new ML model but a clean, high-performance bridge across Rust scanning, Java protocol ingestion, and a browser-native offline viewer—turning diverse data into a unified discovery fabric. It’s pragmatic, fast, and explainable.\n\nImmediate next steps:\n- Prototype scanner-rs with sliceslice-rs and a minimal /scan API; benchmark mmap + multi-pattern throughput.\n- Build ingest-java with HAR upload and GraphQL probe endpoints; wire to Cassandra via JDBC wrapper.\n- Stand up docker-compose with scanner, ingest, cassandra, metrics-exporter, and dgs-example.\n- Implement ConvoForm-based UI for pattern set management and job triggers; add swirldb snapshot export/import.\n\nKey metrics:\n- Bytes scanned per second per core; p99 scan latency for fixed-size inputs.\n- HAR ingestion rate and failure ratio; GraphQL probe latency/distribution.\n- Discovery hit counts by pattern, source, and day; false-positive review outcomes.\n- Cassandra write latencies and partition hotspot metrics; exporter scrape success.\n\nEssential tools/frameworks:\n- Docker/Compose, Rust stable, Spring Boot, Cassandra, Prometheus, and the selected repositories as listed for scanning, ingestion, storage, metrics, and UI.",

It manages the fetch-unpack-configure-build-install process common to installing software from source, or from binary distributions that are not fully fledged OS packages.\n\nThis cookbook started its life as a modified version of Infochimp's install_from cookbook. It has since been heavily refactored and extended to meet different use cases.\n\nGiven a simple project archive available at a url:\n\n```ruby\nark 'pig' do\n  url 'http://apache.org/pig/pig-0.8.0.tar.gz'\nend\n```\n\nThe `ark` resource will:\n\n- fetch it to to `/var/cache/chef/`\n- unpack it to the default path (`/usr/local/pig-0.8.0`)\n- create a symlink for `:home_dir` (`/usr/local/pig`) pointing to path\n- add specified binary commands to the environment `PATH` variable\n\nBy default, the ark will not run again if the `:path` is not empty. Ark provides many actions to accommodate different use cases, such as `:dump`, `:cherry_pick`, `:put`, and `:install_with_make`.\n\nFor remote files ark supports URLs using the [remote_file](http://docs.chef.io/resource_remote_file.html) resource. Local files are accessed with the `file://` syntax.\n\n## Maintainers\n\nThis cookbook is maintained by the Sous Chefs. The Sous Chefs are a community of Chef cookbook maintainers working together to maintain important cookbooks.

Only a relatively low number \n  of connections per nodes needs to be maintained open to achieve good performance.\n  - Nodes discovery: the driver automatically discovers and uses all nodes of the C* cluster, including newly \n  bootstrapped ones.\n  - Transparent fail-over: if C* nodes fail or become unreachable, the driver automatically and transparently tries \n  other nodes and schedules reconnection to the dead nodes in the background.\n  - Convenient schema access: the driver exposes a C* schema in a usable way.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nThe wrapper uses Java Driver for Apache Cassandra® 4.x. This driver is designed for Apache \nCassandra® 2.1+ and DataStax Enterprise (5.0+). So, it will",

Runs in browsers via WebAssembly and as a native Rust sync server.\n\n> ⚠️ **UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT** ⚠️\n>\n> SwirlDB is in early development and not ready for production use.\n> The API is unstable and subject to breaking changes.\n\n📚 **[Full Documentation](https://docs.swirldb.org)**\n\n## Design\n\n- **CRDT-based**: Built on Automerge for automatic conflict resolution\n- **Cross-platform**: Browser WASM (~489KB gzipped) and native Rust server with different optimizations\n- **Pluggable storage**: In-memory, LocalStorage, IndexedDB, or redb\n- **Real-time sync**: WebSocket-based synchronization server\n- **Observable**: Field-level change tracking via observers\n- **Policy engine**: Access control for subscriptions\n\n## Architecture\n\n### Browser and Server Builds\n\n- **Browser**: WebAssembly module with JavaScript bindings\n- **Server**: Native Rust binary for WebSocket/HTTP sync\n\n### Crate Structure\n\n- **swirldb-core**: Platform-agnostic CRDT engine and storage traits\n- **swirldb-browser**: WASM bindings with localStorage and IndexedDB adapters\n- **swirldb-server**: Sync server with redb storage and subscription management\n\nSee [BUILD.md](./BUILD.md) for build instructions.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- **Rust** - Install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)\n- **pnpm** - Install with `npm install -g pnpm` or `brew install pnpm`\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Browser (WASM)\n\n**1. Build the WASM package:**\n```bash\n# From repository root\npnpm run build:wasm\n```\n\n**2. Use in your application:**\n```javascript\nimport { SwirlDB } from '@swirldb/js';\n\n// Configure with LocalStorage adapter (data persists automatically)\nconst db = await SwirlDB.withLocalStorage('my-app');\n\n// Use natural property access via Proxies\ndb.data.user.name = 'Alice';\ndb.data.user.age = 30;\n\n// Read values\nconsole.log(db.data.user.name.$value); // 'Alice'\n\n// Observe changes reactively\ndb.data.user.name.$observe((newValue) => {\n  console.log('Name changed:', newValue);\n})",
