      "readme_snippet": "I built this repo as I went through the OffSec OSTH and OSIR certifications. The repos README takes you through different ways to use splunk, from simple to more advanced use cases; as well as providing as many references as possible for important fields and filter operators. \n\nThe first segments of the readme will take you through how to use splunk, exploring workflows and ways to get information and view it. The second segment goes over sorting and filtering methods; where i go through using commands like stat, WHERE operator, sort, and the | operator. Overall i hope that it acts as a handy reference for you as you go through using splunk and i will be sure to keep updating the repo/readme as i get more ideas, or develop more queries. \n\n\n## Basic Search Structure\n```spl\nindex=* source=\"*\" EventCode=1 \"powershell\"\n```\n\nThis searches ALL indexes for process creation events(which is what eventcode 1 is from sysmon) containing \"powershell\" anywhere in the event. You can also remove eventcode argument and the source and search for all events with \"powershell\"\n\nWhat I like to do with this is not specify the source, as often you wont need to unless you have ALOT of sources with coliding eventcodes(since they arent unique in windows). You can jump from specifing source to having a wildcard\n\n## Wildcards and Text Matching\n```spl\nindex=* \"*net.exe*\"                    # Find ANY event containing net.exe\nindex=* \"192.168\"                      # Find ANY event with this IP pattern\nindex=* \"powershell\" (NOT \"*net.exe*\")   # Find powershell but exclude net.exe\nindex=* \"HOST123\" \"*cmd.exe*\"          # Find cmd.exe on specific host\n```\nWith the (NOT) you can actually keep having many different things (NOT SOMEA) (NOT SOMEB) etc etc. You dont have to be perfectly; just functional. Espciailly when you want to quickly cunt down on things\n\nThe same can be done with AND OR etc or other things, as splunk can be very intutive in allowing you to use plaintext to filter as long as you be ",
