  "refined_goal": "Build a local, air‑gapped “Go Tool Fabric” where Ollama‑hosted code‑capable LLMs dynamically discover, wrap, and execute libraries from avelino/awesome‑go as callable WASM micro‑tools. The system parses Awesome‑Go, performs static analysis on selected repos, auto‑generates minimal Go adapters, compiles to WASM (TinyGo/wasmtime), and exposes each as a structured tool callable via Ollama’s HTTP API with function‑calling prompts. Success = 1) 70%+ one‑shot compile rate on first LLM pass for top‑100 libs, 2) <5s cold‑start to first tool call, 3) 30% reduction in human glue‑code for integration tasks, 4) reproducible builds and provenance logs. Why it matters: it turns a curated index into an instant, safe, composable capability graph the model can actively use—bridging “what exists” and “what can be done” without cloud dependencies, while preserving trust and speed.",
  "repository_synergy": "THE INSIGHT: Treat Awesome‑Go not as a list, but as a latent action space. Each entry is a potential capability the LLM can invoke—if we can render it as a safe, typed, callable unit. Ollama provides local, low‑latency models and a clean HTTP interface; if we let those models dynamically mint small wrappers around Awesome‑Go libraries and compile them to WASM, we effectively give the model a live toolbox that grows as the ecosystem grows.\n\nTHE STORY: Why these repos? Ollama is a batteries‑included local model runtime that normalizes model orchestration via simple APIs and supports code‑centric models with function calling. It’s lean, hackable, and production‑friendly. Awesome‑Go is more than curation; it encodes community consensus and health via listing inertia and link structure. Alternative choices—random GitHub search, generic package registries—lack Awesome‑Go’s implicit reputation filter and taxonomy. Likewise, cloud LLM endpoints would undermine the air‑gapped, reproducible promise we want; Ollama’s local control is the differentiator.\n\nTHE SYNERGY: Marry Ollama’s context‑aware code generation with Awesome‑Go’s trust‑weighted index to form a model‑driven “plugin foundry.” The model selects libraries, our system auto‑derives the safe API surface using Go AST analysis, generates thin adapters, compiles to WASM, and hot‑loads them as tools Ollama can call. The curated list becomes a capability graph; the model becomes a planner; the WASM layer becomes a safety sandbox.\n\nTHE INNOVATION: The illicit connection is repurposing a static awesome‑list into a real‑time, executable function registry. Instead of human glue‑code, we let the model author the glue and immediately test it against a deterministic WASM runtime. This makes high‑quality Go libraries immediately usable by LLMs—without building bespoke integrations by hand. The result is a local, composable AI ops fabric: the model thinks, chooses, compiles, and executes.\n\nTHE BRIDGE: Use Ollama’s tool/spec prompting to publish “ToolCards” for each wrapped library. When the model plans a task—say, stream JSON from Kafka and upsert to Postgres—it invokes a chain of WASM tools generated minutes before from Awesome‑Go picks. The loop is closed by compiler feedback: errors feed back into the model’s next patch. We’ve turned curation into computation.",
  "technical_architecture": "Components and flow:\n- Indexer: Scrapes avelino/awesome‑go, normalizes entries (category, stars, last update), fetches go.mod, and enriches with signals (license, CGO dependencies, test coverage, doc availability). Output: LibraryMetadata JSON.\n- Analyzer: Uses golang.org/x/tools/go/packages to parse ASTs and find safe, minimal call surfaces (pure‑Go only by default). Extracts function signatures and example code. Output: ToolSpec (name, types, constraints, minimal example).\n- Wrapper Generator (LLM‑in‑the‑loop): Calls Ollama (e.g., qwen2.5‑coder:7b or llama3.1‑instruct) with ToolSpec to synthesize a thin adapter in Go that: validates inputs, enforces timeouts, avoids global state, and prints structured JSON. It also emits a fuzzable test.\n- Compiler: Prefers TinyGo to compile adapters to WASM; falls back to ‘go build’ inside a minimal container when TinyGo isn’t supported, then uses wazero/wasmtime for execution. Build cache keyed by git+commit+spec hash; provenance stored in SBOM.\n- Tool Host: A local gRPC/HTTP server that loads WASM modules with a strict ABI: Invoke(tool_name, json_input) -> json_output. It enforces CPU/memory budgets and network policy. Observability via OpenTelemetry traces.\n- Ollama Tool Bridge: Presents each ToolSpec to models via function calling. The bridge translates tool calls to the Tool Host and returns results to Ollama’s /api/chat. Prompts embed current inventory and example calls.\n- Planner/Refiner: A meta‑prompt chain where the model plans multi‑step tasks, invokes tools, inspects outputs, and iterates on code if compilation failed. Compiler diagnostics are summarized and fed back to the model with guardrails.\n\nAPIs and protocols:\n- Ollama HTTP: /api/chat for tool‑calling models; /api/generate for code critique and diff suggestions.\n- Tool Host: HTTP POST /invoke with {tool, input_json}; HTTP GET /catalog for current ToolSpecs; gRPC equivalent for low latency.\n- Provenance: Each tool has ToolID = sha256(repo@commit + adapter source). SBOM stored in CycloneDX, retrievable via /sbom/{toolid}.\n\nKey challenges and solutions:\n- Hallucinated APIs: AST‑derived signatures constrain what the LLM can call; adapters reject unknown symbols at compile time. Prompt templates explicitly include function signatures and examples.\n- Build flakiness: Layered retries, pinned versions via go.mod replace, and prebuilt caches. For CGO libs, mark as “container‑only” and isolate.\n- Security: WASM sandbox with no fs/network by default; explicit allowlist per tool. Input and output strictly JSON; timeouts and memory caps enforced by runtime.\n- Performance: Warm pools of WASM instances; ahead‑of‑time compilation and deduped caches; batched invocations for streaming tools. Inventory compression so the prompt only includes relevant ToolCards.\n\nNon‑obvious optimizations:\n- Train a lightweight error‑to‑patch adapter using your own compile error corpus to reduce fix iterations.\n- Group tools by category and co‑generate multi‑lib adapters to cut cross‑module overhead.\n- Use function‑level RAG: embed signatures and docstrings to retrieve only the relevant surface into the prompt.\n\nIntegration pattern:\n- The model becomes the orchestrator; Awesome‑Go becomes the curated action space; WASM is the safety and portability layer. Ollama binds it all locally with deterministic latency and simple APIs.",
  "expected_impact": "Use cases enabled:\n1) Air‑gapped ETL composer: The model picks ‘segmentio/kafka‑go’ and ‘jackc/pgx’, generates adapters, and streams CDC events to Postgres entirely offline, with per‑tool observability and schema validation.\n2) Edge data wrangling: On a field gateway, the system wraps image processing and compression libs, exposing them as tools the model chains to cleanse and summarize camera feeds within strict CPU/memory budgets.\n3) Instant protocol testers: Given a device spec, the model selects MQTT/CoAP clients, builds WASM probes, and executes conformance checks with autogenerated traces.\n4) Threat‑model sandbox: Security libs (hashing, TLS parsers) are wrapped as pure functions, letting the model generate and run fuzz inputs safely in WASM and report corpus stats.\n5) Migration copilots: For a Go monolith, the model maps ORM calls to pgx/SQLc tools, auto‑generates minimal repros, and produces a verified migration plan with runnable adapters.\n6) Data science glue: The model wraps Go numerical libs (gonum), composes analysis steps as tools, and emits a CLI pipeline that is reproducible and version‑pinned.\n7) Compliance evidencing: Each adapter emits SBOM and test logs; auditors can reproduce tool builds from commit hashes with deterministic WASM artifacts.\n\nScalability and extensibility:\n- Horizontal scale via stateless Tool Host replicas; build cache backed by a shared store; ToolCards are small JSON.\n- Extensible to other awesome‑lists (e.g., awesome‑rust) by swapping analyzer/generator stages, keeping Ollama and the Tool Host.\n\nLimitations and mitigations:\n- Not all libs are TinyGo/WASM‑friendly; use containerized fallbacks or limit to pure‑Go first.\n- LLM code quality varies; use multi‑model ensembles (fast coder for drafts, larger model for critique) and enforce compile‑test gates.\n- Cold starts for rare tools; prewarm based on task hints and popularity.\n- License quirks; the Indexer enforces license allowlists and flags GPL for human review.",
  "innovation_analysis": "Innovation score: 9.1/10. The twist—turning a curated list into a live, executable action space for a local LLM—creates a new class of system: curation‑to‑computation via on‑demand adapters and WASM safety.\n\nImmediate next steps:\n- Build the Indexer/Analyzer and produce ToolSpecs for the top 50 Awesome‑Go libs with pure‑Go surfaces.\n- Implement the Tool Host (wazero/wasmtime) and the Ollama Tool Bridge with function calling prompts.\n- Prototype the wrapper generator loop (generate → compile → test → refine) using qwen2.5‑coder:7b in Ollama.\n- Ship two end‑to‑end demos: Kafka→Postgres ETL and MQTT protocol tester.\n\nMetrics:\n- First‑pass compile success rate; median time‑to‑first‑call; tool invocation latency; number of refinement loops; user task completion rate; SBOM coverage.\n\nEssential tools:\n- Ollama (qwen2.5‑coder, llama‑3.1‑instruct), Go toolchain + TinyGo, wazero/wasmtime, OpenTelemetry, CycloneDX, golang.org/x/tools, container runtime for fallbacks.",
