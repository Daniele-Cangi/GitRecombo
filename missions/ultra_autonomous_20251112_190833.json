It's a hands-on and detailed book that covers an end-to-end LLM application from design to deployment. The LLM course will always stay free but feel free to support my work by purchasing the book.\n\nFor an interactive version of this course, I created an LLM assistant that will answer questions and test your knowledge in a personalized way on [**HuggingChat**](https://hf.co/chat/assistant/66029d2e5f4a884f7aabc9d1) or [**ChatGPT**](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-yviLuLqvI-llm-course).\n\n## 📝 Notebooks\n\nA list of notebooks and articles I wrote about LLMs.\n\n### Tools\n\n| Notebook | Description | Notebook |\n|----------|-------------|----------|\n| 🧐 [LLM AutoEval](https://github.com/mlabonne/llm-autoeval) | Automatically evaluate your LLMs using RunPod | <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Igs3WZuXAIv9X0vwqiE90QlEPys8e8Oa?usp=sharing\"><img src=\"img/colab.svg\" alt=\"Open In Colab\"></a> |\n| 🥱 LazyMergekit | Easily merge models using MergeKit in one click. | <a href=\"https://",

Concepts are explained in the articles of prominent engineers and credible references. Case studies are taken from battle-tested systems that serve millions to billions of users.\n\n#### If your system goes slow\n> Understand your problems: scalability problem (fast for a single user but slow under heavy load) or performance problem (slow for a single user) by reviewing some [design principles](#principle) and checking how [scalability](#scalability) and [performance](#performance) problems are solved at tech companies. The section of [intelligence](#intelligence) are created for those who work with data and machine learning at big (data) and deep (learning) scale.\n\n#### If your system goes down\n> \"Even if you lose all one day, you can build all over again if you retain your calm!\" - Thuan Pham, former CTO of Uber. So, keep calm and mind the [availability](#availability) and [stability](#stability) matters! \n\n#### If you are having a system design interview\n> Look at some [interview notes](#interview) and [real-world architectures with completed diagrams](#architecture) to get a comprehensive view before designing your system on whiteboard. You can check some [talks](#talk) of engineers from tech giants to know how they build, scale, and optimize their systems. Good luck!\n\n#### If you are building your dream team\n> The goal of scaling team is not growing team size but increasing team output and value. You can find out how tech companies reach that goal in various aspects: hiring, management, organization, culture, and communication in the [organization](#organization) section.\n\n#### Community power\n\n> Contributions are greatly welcome! You may want to take a look at the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). If you see a link here that is no longer maintained or is not a good fit, plea",
