  "refined_goal": "Build GitRecombo: a self-hosted, ultra-autonomous discovery engine that mines GitHub in near-real time, derives lightweight embeddings from code and docs, and spins up live, typed API harnesses against discovered services—then visualizes and A/B tests them in dual-skinned dashboards. Under the hood: a zero-ML-weight, memory-bounded embedding stack (random indexing + char n-gram SIF + MinHash/LSH) integrated into a Spring Boot orchestrator; Retrofit used as a dynamic type generator + probe runner with custom CallAdapter/Converter factories; Tabler and AdminLTE swapped on-the-fly via a CSS polyglot adapter. Success: <7s time-to-first-probe after discovery, <512MB RAM embedding pipeline, >0.72 F1 on relevance at k=20, and live endpoint validation across 200 repos/hour. Why it matters: it compresses the loop from \"What’s out there?\" to \"I’m calling it now\" into minutes—without heavyweight models—unlocking scalable, trustworthy recombination of open-source capability.",
  "repository_synergy": "THE INSIGHT: Treat Retrofit not merely as an HTTP client but as a code generator for executable hypotheses. Pair it with a lightweight embedding engine that rapidly identifies promising repos/endpoints; then auto-synthesize Retrofit interfaces to probe those endpoints in parallel. Use Spring Boot as the orchestration substrate where discovery, typing, probing, and scoring become first-class pipelines. Wrap the results in a UI that can switch skins between Tabler and AdminLTE—turning human-in-the-loop sensemaking into a fast, pleasant, and consistent experience—while the engine evolves autonomously in the background.\n\nTHE STORY: Why these repos, not the obvious ones? We could have picked a classic vector database and a heavy LLM to parse READMEs, and a popular React admin boilerplate. Instead, we went iconoclastic: Retrofit (typically a mobile client) provides an annotation DSL and pluggable factories that are perfect for on-the-fly, strongly-typed probes from text-extracted endpoints—far safer than ad-hoc curl. Spring Boot gives a bulletproof, introspectable runtime with scheduling, Actuator metrics, and configuration that can run anywhere from laptop to serverless to k8s—ideal for continuous discovery. Tabler and AdminLTE, two different admin UI frameworks, become a comparative visualization surface; we create a polyglot CSS adapter so one dataset yields two experiences without changing the markup. That dual-skin A/B lets us catch cognitive and layout friction as the autonomous system scales.\n\nTHE SYNERGY: Lightweight embeddings decide what to try; Retrofit makes trying safe, fast, and typed; Spring orchestrates the feedback loop; Tabler/AdminLTE turn the outcomes into actionable dashboards. The illicit bridge is twofold:\n- Retrofit ConverterFactory as vectorizer: we expose a logical endpoint (emb://) that looks like HTTP to Retrofit but is intercepted to run local embeddings. The same interface can later point to a real remote embedding service—with zero call-site change.\n- A CSS polyglot adapter that maps shared component primitives (cards, nav, tables, badges) to either Tabler or AdminLTE via custom properties and class aliasing. One semantic UI, two skins, runtime-switchable.\n\nTHE INNOVATION: This stack makes synthesis cheap: each discovered repo yields structured signals (novelty, health, relevance, diversity), a typed hypothesis (Retrofit interface), immediate validation runs, and a human-visible dashboard of what’s promising. The move from brittle scraping to typed interface probes is the key: we leverage Retrofit’s annotation DSL to codify assumptions we can refute quickly. Tabler/AdminLTE are not just themes—they’re levers for operator cognition. Spring Boot stitches this into a continuous, observable machine. The payoff: a system that recombines open-source capability at scale without heavyweight models, and that can later swap in heavier semantics without a rewrite.",
  "technical_architecture": "Components and flow:\n- Ingestor (Spring Boot): Schedules GitHub scans via Retrofit-based GitHub API clients. Applies ETag and conditional requests to minimize rate usage; OkHttp connection pooling for throughput.\n- Parser/Signalizer: Extracts candidate endpoints from READMEs, OpenAPI files, code comments, and package manifests using fast regex + heuristic tokenizers. Computes signals: novelty (n-gram rarity), health (stars, commits, issues), author (org/user heuristics), semantic relevance (light embedding cosine), diversity (LSH collision reduction).\n- Lightweight Embedding Engine: Random Indexing of char 3–5-grams into 2048-dim sparse vectors; SIF weighting by inverse n-gram frequency; optional power-iteration to de-bias principal directions on batches. MinHash signatures for LSH; HNSW-lite or LSH Forest for ANN search. All in-memory with ring-buffer persistence; <512MB target.\n- Retrofit Hypothesis Builder: Synthesizes Java interfaces from extracted endpoints. A small template engine assembles @GET/@POST methods with @Path/@Query from pattern-mined parameters. Type safety via conservative defaults (String/Map) on unknowns; evolves if OpenAPI discovered.\n- Dual Retrofit Fabric: Two custom factories:\n  1) ConverterFactory emb:// for local vectorization calls (Retrofit treats it as an endpoint, OkHttp interceptor routes scheme to in-process module). Enables composability with call adapters, retries, and metrics.\n  2) CallAdapterFactory for probe scheduling that wraps each call in circuit breakers, backoff, and SLA timers; supports streaming via Server-Sent Events.\n- Probe Runner: Executes synthesized APIs against candidate endpoints, validates status codes, schema hints, auth requirements, pagination behaviors, and rate limits. Stores metrics in a compact store (H2/SQLite via Spring Data).\n- Orchestrator/Scoring: Combines probe outcomes with signals to re-rank candidates. Diversity-aware selection uses LSH buckets to avoid near-duplicates. Decision engine defines next probes within rate limits.\n- UI Webapp: Spring MVC + Thymeleaf templates with semantic CSS classes. Runtime theme switcher injects either Tabler or AdminLTE bundles. CSS polyglot adapter defines a map of semantic classes (ui-card, ui-badge, ui-table) to framework classes and variables. SSE feeds live logs/metrics.\n- Storage/Indexing: Lightweight KV for vectors and signatures; relational tables for repos, endpoints, probes, metrics. Snapshot writer for exporting to parquet/CSV.\n\nKey technical choices and optimizations:\n- Retrofit on server-side: chosen for its annotation DSL and pluggable factories; dramatically simplifies typed probing vs hand-rolled clients.\n- Virtual host interceptor: gh://owner/repo/path mapped to locally cached blobs; OkHttp fetches from cache or falls back to raw.githubusercontent.com with ETag, making content access uniform.\n- Backpressure: SSE emits bounded buffers; probe runner uses bounded thread pools plus GitHub token-bucket rate limiter; sampling tuned to maintain <2% 429 responses.\n- Search and ranking: Two-stage retrieval—LSH/ANN to shortlist 200 repos, then exact cosine with SIF embeddings for top-k; rerank with novelty and health weights to meet blueprint.\n- Safety net: Probes default to HEAD/OPTIONS before GET/POST; timeouts <2s; content sniffing prevents accidental large downloads.\n- Interfaces/APIs:\n  - /api/ingest?topics=...&days=7 triggers scan\n  - /api/search?q=... returns candidates with vectors and signals\n  - /api/probe/{repo}/{endpointId} runs or re-runs a probe\n  - /api/themes/current GET/POST to switch Tabler/AdminLTE\n  - /api/metrics/stream SSE for progress and errors\n- Why Spring Boot: Actuator provides health and metrics; Scheduling and Conditional beans keep modules swappable; testcontainers-ready. Why dual CSS frameworks: validates cognitive ergonomics and maintains UI resilience.\n\nSecurity and compliance:\n- GitHub tokens in Spring Vault-compatible property sources; per-request scope.\n- Sanitization of logs and URLs; no exfiltration of secrets in probe output.\n- License awareness: store repo license and restrict probes if incompatible with policy.\n\nMigration path: The emb:// converter can later redirect to an external embedding microservice; the UI can swap in a modern SPA without back-end changes; the Retrofit interfaces can be exported as OpenAPI via reflective inspection.",
  "expected_impact": "Use cases uniquely enabled by this combo:\n- Instant typed harness for emergent APIs: A new repo publishes a draft HTTP interface in its README. Within minutes, GitRecombo synthesizes a Retrofit interface, probes OPTIONS/HEAD, validates CORS and auth hints, and surfaces a working call snippet. Operators can fire a live call and view structured results without writing any client code.\n- Dual-skin operator cockpit: Analysts compare discovery outcomes in Tabler vs AdminLTE in real time. The same semantic markup renders into different visual hierarchies; the team measures which skin yields faster triage (lower dwell time per decision) and keeps that data.\n- Lightweight embedding bake-off: Toggle between random indexing + SIF and MinHash-only modes on a weekly crawl. Measure precision@k and time-to-first-probe to demonstrate that sub-512MB embeddings can outperform naive keyword search for this domain.\n- API drift radar: The probe runner schedules periodic validations on previously good endpoints. Retrofit’s typed contracts reveal breaking changes immediately; the UI highlights drifts and proposes updated method signatures.\n- Corporate OSS triage: Point the ingestor at internal GitHub Enterprise. Within the confines of a network perimeter, teams get automated clients and dashboards for internal services—no heavyweight ML stack required.\n- Offline edge scouting: Ship the orchestrator to air-gapped environments with pre-snapshotted repos. emb:// keeps embeddings local. Discovery and probing continue offline; results sync when connectivity returns.\n- Diversity-aware exploration: The LSH-driven reranker avoids clusters of near-duplicate libraries, pushing truly different candidates to the surface—exactly the kind of surprise that spurs recombination.\n\nScalability and extensibility:\n- Horizontal scale out by sharding ANN/LSH indices and probe pools.\n- Embedding module can be hot-swapped to a remote service with no API change.\n- UI themes are pluggable by adding a new CSS map; semantics remain stable.\n\nLimitations and mitigations:\n- Heuristic endpoint extraction can hallucinate parameters; mitigation: conservative default types, OPTIONS sniffing, and human review checkpoints.\n- GitHub rate limits: mitigate via ETag caching, multi-token rotation, and backoff.\n- CSS collisions: the polyglot adapter may miss edge cases; add visual regression tests and allow per-component overrides.\n- Dynamic Retrofit typing is inherently lossy without schemas; when OpenAPI is found, prioritize it to refine interfaces.",
  "innovation_analysis": "Innovation score: 8.6/10. It repurposes Retrofit as an executable hypothesis engine, fuses it with a zero-ML-weight embedding pipeline, and treats dual CSS frameworks as an ergonomic switch—non-obvious, synergistic, and practical.\n\nImmediate next steps:\n- Implement emb:// ConverterFactory and VirtualHost Interceptor.\n- Build the semantic CSS map and runtime theme switcher.\n- Stand up the ingest → embed → LSH shortlist → Retrofit synthesize → probe pipeline with Actuator metrics and SSE.\n- Run a 7-day crawl of targeted topics; collect precision@k, time-to-first-probe, and probe success rates.\n\nKey metrics:\n- Relevance@20 (precision/F1), unique-service discovery rate/day, probe success ratio, average time-to-first-probe, RAM footprint of embedding engine, operator decision dwell time per candidate.\n\nEssential tools/frameworks:\n- Spring Boot (web, actuator, data), Retrofit + OkHttp, H2/SQLite, Thymeleaf, Tabler + AdminLTE assets, JMH for microbenchmarks, WireMock for probe tests, Testcontainers for integration, GitHub REST via Retrofit. This stack can prove the thesis quickly and scale responsibly.",
