  "refined_goal": "Build a zero-LLM endpoint defense and attribution system that lives on your PC, intercepts phishing across email, web, and files, and produces a cryptographically verifiable evidence graph that links attempts to their hosting infrastructure (domains, IPs, ASNs, certs, favicons, software stacks). Architecture: a Go/C# agent with deterministic pipelines (BK-tree domain lookalike detection, Unicode-confusables mapping, YARA/Sigma rules, JA3/TLS and favicon perceptual hashes, WHOIS/RDAP/CT scans), Docker-based detonation lab for attachments, and a React/ImGui UI. Success: <50 ms URL decision latency; 90%+ precision on brand lookalikes; automated evidence packs (PCAP, TLS, WHOIS) in <90 s; 0 user-mode crashes in 10k events; >95% safe redirect resolution coverage. Why it matters: it turns phishing from a vague social risk into a measurable, auditable infrastructure event you can block, explain, and lawfully report within minutes—without relying on any LLMs.",
  "repository_synergy": "The insight: media downloaders are world-class at surviving hostile URLs. yt-dlp/youtube-dl carry years of hardened logic for decoding obfuscated redirects, JS signatures, and peculiar headers. Repurposed, they become a robust, sandbox-friendly URL normalizer and metadata miner for phishing links—no rendering, no JS execution, just deterministic peeling of redirect chains. Pair that with Moby’s containers to detonate attachments in tight boxes; PowerToys to surface protections natively in Windows workflows; and a React/ImGui split UI for both rich dashboards and instant, low-latency overlays.\n\nWhy these repos: yt-dlp/youtube-dl give us a Swiss army knife of URL handling that phishers inadvertently target (shorteners, embedded redirects, base64 blobs). LangChain—oddly, without an LLM—gives an elegant DAG to orchestrate tools, tracing, and retries with backoff; its Expression Language becomes a rule engine for deterministic functions. Ollama—also without models—becomes a clever offline artifact registry for signed rulepacks (YARA, Sigma, confusables maps, brand favicon hashes) using its simple pull/version workflow and local HTTP. PowerToys is the best-kept secret for Windows-native UX hooks (Run plugin, context menus, quick overlays). Moby supplies reproducible, ephemeral sandboxes to throw untrusted files into. React is our detailed analyst console; ImGui is our zero-latency alert overlay. trekhleb/javascript-algorithms provides the fundamentals (BK-tree, Levenshtein, Bloom filters) to make the heuristics fast and tight. PayloadsAllTheThings, curated responsibly, is a goldmine of real signatures to harden our detectors and build realistic detonation playbooks. Tabby provides a comfortable incident terminal. awesome-go points us to miekg/dns, gopacket, and geoip2—battle-tested building blocks.\n\nThe synergy: treat yt-dlp’s extractor framework as the “phish expander,” Moby as the “glass box,” PowerToys as the “native glove,” and LangChain-as-DAG as the “spinal cord.” Then abuse Ollama as a signed, offline content distribution network for rules and evidence schemas, not models. The innovation: you get a personal SIEM+sandbox that—instead of guessing with an LLM—collects verifiable indicators, attributes infrastructure through CT logs, WHOIS/RDAP, JA3 and icon hashes, and outputs a machine-checkable case bundle. The bridge: reframe two LLM-centric repos (LangChain, Ollama) into non-LLM infrastructure primitives; reframe media scrapers (yt-dlp/youtube-dl) into redirect peelers; reframe PowerToys into a stealthy endpoint HMI.",
  "technical_architecture": "Components:\n- Endpoint Agent (Go + C#):\n  - URL Guard: browser and clipboard hooks capture outbound URLs; uses yt-dlp/youtube-dl extractors in --dump-json mode inside a netns-limited container to expand redirects and collect headers, TLS cert chain, and mime hints. No JS execution.\n  - Domain Intelligence: trekhleb BK-tree and Levenshtein against a brand corpus; Unicode confusables map; TLD swaps; IDN punycode checks; Bloom filter of known-bad hashes. JA3/JA4 fingerprints for outbound TLS; FavHash (Murmur/xxHash of favicon bytes) for page fingerprinting when fetched via HEAD-range.\n  - File Guard: File Explorer context menu (PowerToys plugin). On open or download, route to Detonation Lab.\n  - Evidence Graph: local immutable log (Merkle-tree with Blake3) stores indicators (URL→IP→ASN→CERT CN→CT entry→Favicon hash). Graph serialized to signed JSON-LD.\n- Detonation Lab (Moby):\n  - Disposable containers (gVisor/AppArmor): Office/PDF detonation via libreoffice-headless (for macro extraction), oletools/pdfid/pdf-parser, capa for PE triage, YARA scan. Network egress blocked, but PCAP loopback capture with gopacket for full trace of any attempt.\n  - Suricata plug-in for rules-based behavior; Sigma rules for Windows event mirroring (where applicable via ETW mirrors in user-mode).\n- Rulepack Registry (Ollama repurposed): signed tarballs of rules (YARA/Sigma), brand corpora, confusables, Favicon hashes, and playbooks; versioned by tag, pulled offline (no LLM). Local HTTP serves rule manifests to Agent.\n- Orchestrator (LangChain LCEL without models): DAG of pure functions with retries; callbacks provide structured tracing. E.g., Email Intake → URL Extract → Expand → Heuristics → Evidence → Verdict → UI.\n- UI:\n  - React Analyst Console: case timeline, graph visualization, one-click report generator (abuse@, CERT). Training microdrills (freeCodeCamp style) simulate safe phish to improve user reflexes.\n  - ImGui Overlay: 20–40 ms heads-up when a lookalike or suspicious chain is clicked; offers Open in Sandboxed Browser or Block.\n  - Tabby Terminal: incident console embedding CLI tools (WHOIS, RDAP, dig) proxied through the Agent for logged queries.\n\nAPIs and protocols:\n- Agent↔Lab: gRPC over Unix/Named Pipes; protobuf for evidence and task spec.\n- Agent↔UI: localhost HTTP/WS; Server-Sent Events for live alerts.\n- Registry: localhost Ollama-like REST endpoints mapping to rulepack pulls; SHA256/Ed25519 signatures.\n\nPerformance and defenses:\n- Cache expanded redirects and DNS answers with TTL; Bloom filters prefilter brands; BK-tree preheated in memory-mapped file for O(log n) lookups.\n- Sandbox creates network namespaces with BPF egress filter; timeboxed runs (e.g., 30s) and CPU caps avoid hangs.\n- All untrusted parsing occurs in containers; the Agent only ingests structured outputs.\n- Evidence Pack Builder uses deterministic hashes (Blake3) for reproducibility.\n\nIntegration patterns:\n- PowerToys plugin calls Agent via local HTTP for file/URL analysis.\n- yt-dlp custom extractor: “CredentialHarvesterGeneric” searches DOM statically (no JS) for common phish forms, CSRF-less posts, and brand assets; returns structured signals.\n- awesome-go libs: miekg/dns for RDNS/NS walking; oschwald/geoip2 for ASN; gopacket for PCAP; cert parsing via crypto/x509; JA3 calculation.\n- PayloadsAllTheThings informs detonation playbooks and YARA samples, curated and sandbox-confined.",
  "expected_impact": "- One-click Quarantine with Context: User downloads an invoice.docm. PowerToys context menu triggers detonation; oletools reveals macros contacting a known C2 ASN. Evidence pack with YARA hits, CT logs of cert reuse, and PCAP is generated and the file is sealed.\n- Redirect Peeler for SMS Phish: Clipboard catch of bit.ly link. yt-dlp expands to a cloaked domain with IDN lookalike of a bank; FavHash matches known phish kit favicon. Overlay blocks with provenance shown and safe contact options.\n- Corporate Brand Protections at the Edge: BK-tree detects lookalikes of your own domain in inbound links. Auto-submits abuse-ready takedown evidence (WHOIS, RDAP, hosting contact) with signed bundle.\n- USB Drop Defense: New EXE from USB triggers sandbox run; capa classifies as RAT family; egress attempts recorded, blocked, and correlated to a domain from a recent email—tying a campaign together.\n- Macro-less PDF Trap: pdfid flags suspicious JS; Suricata rules fire on extracted URLs; the Agent crosslinks to CT log entries showing the cert minted 2 hours ago.\n- Training Microdrills: FreeCodeCamp-style React modules periodically simulate safe phish in the user’s environment, measuring reflexes and improving overlay UX based on behavior.\n- Team-Ready Evidence: Graph JSON-LD exports to your IR platform; Manim renders a short animation timeline for leadership.\n\nLimitations and mitigations:\n- Human attribution is out of scope; we attribute infrastructure only and provide reporting workflows (no vigilante action).\n- Some phish use JS/Canvas gating; we avoid JS execution for safety—users can open a sealed sandboxed browser to inspect.\n- Sandbox evasion exists; multiple base images and behavior rules mitigate but not eliminate evasion.\n- OS integrations vary; on macOS/Linux we use equivalent hooks instead of PowerToys.",
  "innovation_analysis": "Innovation score: 8.6/10. The twist—abusing media downloaders for safe redirect peeling, using LLM-era infra (LangChain, Ollama) as a deterministic pipeline and rule registry, and fusing Moby sandboxes with Windows-native PowerToys UX—yields a personal, verifiable, zero-LLM threat lab on every PC.\n\nNext steps (2 weeks):\n- Build the URL Guard prototype: BK-tree domain lookalike + yt-dlp expander in a netns container; ImGui overlay MVP.\n- Detonation Lab: Dockerfile with oletools/pdfid/capa/YARA; gRPC schema for tasks/evidence.\n- Rulepack registry: sign and serve initial corpora via repurposed Ollama pull.\n- PowerToys plugin: context menu + Run command wired to Agent.\n\nKey metrics:\n- URL decision latency; redirect coverage; lookalike precision/recall; sandbox detonation throughput; evidence pack reproducibility rate.\n\nEssential tools:\n- Go, C#, React, ImGui, Moby, yt-dlp/youtube-dl, YARA/Sigma, Suricata, gopacket, miekg/dns, Blake3, Ed25519.",

Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.\n* **Component-Based:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.\n* **Learn Once, Write Anywhere:** We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) and power mobile apps using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).\n\n[Learn how to use React in your project](https://react.dev/learn).\n\n## Installation\n\nReact has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and **you can use as little or as much React as you need**:\n",

This repository began as a personal project by the author of [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/) for the purpose of animating those videos, with video-specific code available [here](https://github.com/3b1b/videos).  In 2020 a group of developers forked it into what is now the [community edition](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/), with a goal of being more stable, better tested, quicker to respond to community contributions, and all around friendlier to get started with. See [this page](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/faq/installation.html#different-versions) for more details.\n\n## Installation\n> [!Warning]\n> **WARNING:** These instructions are for ManimGL _only_.
