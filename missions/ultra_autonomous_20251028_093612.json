  "refined_goal": "Build a local-first, cross‑platform PC defense stack that: (1) detects and contains phishing‑borne compromises; (2) safely detonates suspicious artifacts in an ephemeral container sandbox; (3) performs evidence‑grade, OSINT‑backed attribution of phishing sources; and (4) presents a human‑centered incident cockpit. The core includes a light TensorFlow anomaly model (TF/TFLite) for per‑process behavioral scoring, a Docker/Moby sandbox for attachment/link detonation, an MCP‑based tool plane for modular sensors, a Flutter desktop/mobile console for operations, Mermaid attack graphs for clarity, and optional decoy canaries inspired by CamPishingBot patterns. Success = <2% FP on baseline processes, <60s sandbox verdicts, automated header→attribution pipelines with >80% accurate origin inference, and one‑click incident packages. This matters because it upgrades a single PC into a principled, evidence‑collecting, self‑defending node—without depending on cloud black boxes.",
  "repository_synergy": "THE INSIGHT: Treat endpoint defense like a composable tooling fabric. Model Context Protocol (MCP) gives us a standard to expose sensors and actuators as tools; Moby makes every high‑risk step reproducible and reversible (containers, snapshots, discardable state); Flutter turns the result into an operator‑friendly cockpit; TensorFlow provides just‑enough intelligence for anomaly scoring; Mermaid converts raw telemetry into living attack graphs; OSINT via Public‑APIs turns raw indicators into attribution; PayloadsAllTheThings seeds signatures and test artifacts; and CamPishingBot teaches us the attacker’s funnel so we can build safe decoys and better detectors. Screenshot‑to‑Code is the wild card: when a phish supplies only images (or the landing page changes constantly), we can reconstruct a local, sandboxed facsimile to probe safely—without granting the adversary any live callbacks.\n\nTHE STORY: Why these repos, not the obvious EDR stack + random UI? MCP/servers lets us treat every capability (process scanner, email parser, docker detonator, OSINT lookup) as a first‑class tool with a typed schema. That means rapid composition and audits: you can literally inspect and test each tool in isolation. Moby gives a hermetic lab: suspicious docs and links never touch the host; even the network egress can be routed via a proxy/gateway for recording or blocked entirely, and we can nuke containers between runs. Flutter provides a single codebase for desktop and mobile—so you can receive a high‑fidelity alert on your phone, pause a process on your laptop, and watch an animated incident timeline later. Mermaid creates the shared language between machines and humans—attack paths, email header flows, and sandbox IO graphs render consistently. TensorFlow lets us add a compact behavioral model (autoencoder on per‑process features like child‑proc fan‑out, network burstiness, and command‑line entropy) that elevates unusual execution chains without turning the project into a heavyweight AI system.\n\nTHE SYNERGY: Public‑APIs becomes a living index for ready‑to‑wire OSINT endpoints (URL/Domain/IP reputation, passive DNS, WHOIS). We codify them behind MCP tools, so swapping providers is trivial. PayloadsAllTheThings converts from an offensive treasure chest into defensive detection packs and self‑tests: from macro lure motifs to URL obfuscation tricks, we distill rules and YARA‑like patterns that our sensors flag. CamPishingBot’s flow teaches reconnaissance of camera‑based lures; we invert it into detector rules (webcam permission prompts in webviews, fake verification pages, timing of redirect chains) and optional decoy pages that log metadata only (time, user‑agent, IP ASN)—no counter‑attack, just canary‑grade signal.\n\nTHE INNOVATION: By making every capability a containerizable tool with an MCP face, we unlock a build‑your‑own‑EDR for individuals and small teams. The combination isn’t obvious: MCP is usually for LLM tool orchestration; here it’s our uniform control plane. Flutter is usually app UI; here it’s a professional SOC console in your pocket. Mermaid is usually documentation; here it animates real‑time kill‑chains. Screenshot‑to‑Code is usually design prototyping; here it becomes a safe reproduction mechanism for volatile phishing sites. And TensorFlow is kept intentionally light—no model zoo bloat—just enough to learn your machine’s habits.\n\nTHE BRIDGE: We implement a local MCP Orchestrator that speaks to MCP Servers: security‑sensor (process + network telemetry), email‑intake (RFC822 parsing + header heuristics), docker‑detonator (Moby), osint‑hub (Public‑APIs), rule‑engine (PayloadsAllTheThings‑derived signatures), ml‑scorer (TensorFlow), and viz‑bridge (Mermaid graph serialization). Flutter talks only to the Orchestrator over a local WebSocket, receiving events and Graph DSL, then rendering: lists, triage modals, Mermaid diagrams embedded via WebView. The result: a trustworthy, modular, and explainable defense stack.",
  "technical_architecture": "Components and Data Flows:\n1) MCP Orchestrator (TypeScript, based on modelcontextprotocol/servers patterns)\n- Purpose: A local controller exposing a single WebSocket and REST interface to Flutter. It registers and routes calls to MCP tool servers. It enforces timeouts, rate limiting, and writes append‑only incident journals.\n- Tools (MCP servers):\n  a) security-sensor: process snapshot, child/parent relations, command‑line entropy, DNS queries (via OS APIs), socket events. Output: NDJSON events.\n  b) email-intake: accepts .eml files or IMAP pulls, parses headers (SPF, DKIM results if present), extracts URLs/attachments, deobfuscates common patterns.\n  c) docker-detonator: wraps Moby to spin ephemeral containers (e.g., headless browser or unoconv + ClamAV images). It copies artifacts in, runs scripted analyses, captures pcap/stdout/stderr, and blocks egress by default (user‑toggle).\n  d) osint-hub: providers catalog sourced from public-apis/public-apis (URL reputation, WHOIS, IP geolocation). Standardized schema: {indicator, provider, score, evidence_link}.\n  e) rule-engine: compiles detection packs distilled from swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings (regexes for URL hiding, macro markers, suspicious HTML forms). Also houses simple YARA‑like signatures for strings in attachments.\n  f) ml-scorer: TensorFlow (Python service or TFLite FFI) that ingests rolling features per process: child‑proc count delta, cross‑signed binary ratio, command‑line entropy, DNS burstiness, byte‑rate variance, signing reputation (optional). Model: small autoencoder or one‑class NN. Exposes /score with 3–8ms typical latency on CPU.\n  g) viz-bridge: converts events to Mermaid state/sequence/flow diagrams: email header path → MTA hops; process tree → kill chain; sandbox network graph → outbound beacons.\n  h) decoy-crafter (optional): hosts innocuous canary pages (no malware) using patterns inspired by CamPishingBot funnels; logs only passive metadata when clicked (legally safe, no exploitation).\n\n2) UI Plane (Flutter desktop/mobile)\n- Communicates with Orchestrator via secure WebSocket (localhost or LAN). Uses platform channels/FFI only if TFLite is local. Embeds a WebView for Mermaid rendering and triage forms. Features: live alerts, evidence browser (pcaps, logs, headers), one‑click sandbox, and guided remediation.\n\n3) Storage\n- Local SQLite/Lightning FS for event indices; immutable incident bundles (zip: logs, pcaps, Mermaid graph, OSINT results, model scores). Optional S3‑compatible sync if user configures (off by default).\n\nAPI/Interfaces:\n- ws://localhost:8877/stream: push NDJSON events {type, timestamp, severity, refs}.\n- POST /mcp/run {tool, args}: invoke MCP tools: e.g., docker-detonator.run({image, cmd, artifact-id}).\n- POST /ml/score {feature_vector}: returns {score, z, flags}.\n- POST /osint/lookup {indicator, providers[]}: merges results with provider weights.\n- GET /viz/mermaid/:id: returns Mermaid DSL for render.\n\nKey Challenges and Solutions:\n- Trust boundaries: The sandbox runs in Moby with a dedicated network namespace; default no‑egress. The Orchestrator injects a recording proxy for egress‑on‑demand. Artifacts are copied via Docker volumes mounted read‑only on host.\n- Performance: Sensors stream raw events to a ring buffer; feature extraction occurs in C/Go (tiny agents) with batched calls to ml-scorer. We keep the model <200KB for CPU‑only inference under 10ms.\n- Noise and FPs: We bootstrap a per‑host baseline period (48h) feeding the autoencoder; the rule‑engine handles known bad, ML elevates unknown suspicious, and OSINT adjudicates.\n- UX clarity: Mermaid diagrams are generated server‑side so the client only renders; large graphs are chunked by phase (Initial Access → Execution → C2) to avoid WebView jank.\n- Optional reconstruction: screenshot-to-code may be used offline to scaffold a sandboxed HTML facsimile of a phish landing page for safe static analysis. It is opt‑in and never connects to attacker infrastructure.\n\nIntegration Patterns:\n- MCP as glue: each capability is a discoverable tool; adding a new OSINT provider = one YAML+handler. Swapping sandbox image = one parameter change.\n- Go micro‑agents: lightweight process/net probes (inspired by avelino/awesome-go ecosystem patterns) feed JSON to MCP. No kernel drivers required.\n- Visualization: Mermaid DSL is cached; animations for training or post‑mortems can be produced by manim from the same event timelines if desired.",
  "expected_impact": "Use Cases:\n1) Suspicious macro‑enabled invoice: User saves the .docx. One click in Flutter triggers docker-detonator with a LibreOffice+monitor image. The sandbox observes AutoOpen macros reaching out to bit.ly → deobfuscated domain. Rule‑engine flags macro markers; OSINT confirms low reputation; Mermaid shows Email → Attachment → Sandbox → C2 attempt. Verdict in under 60s, no host risk.\n2) PowerShell abuse detection: A process burst spawns powershell.exe with long base64 arg. security-sensor flags high cmd‑entropy; ml-scorer assigns high anomaly; rule-engine matches PowerShell download‑exec patterns. Flutter prompts to suspend the parent process and isolate network for 5 minutes. User accepts, incident bundle generated.\n3) Email header attribution: A phish bypasses SPF. email-intake parses Received headers and DKIM failures; osint-hub correlates sending IP to a known bulletproof hoster ASN. The tool suggests reporting with prefilled abuse contacts; Mermaid renders the mail hop chain for audit.\n4) Link‑only phish with rotating content: Instead of visiting the live URL, decoy-crafter hosts a local facsimile page (optionally scaffolded via screenshot-to-code). Embedded JavaScript analysis in a sandbox reveals obfuscated form posts and exfil endpoints without contacting the adversary.\n5) USB lure analysis: A found USB holds a suspicious PDF. detonation container runs PDF parser + network monitor. PayloadsAllTheThings signatures catch embedded launch actions; no egress allowed; a clean PDF is generated for viewing.\n6) Executive mobile alerts: Flutter mobile app receives push when an anomaly crosses threshold while the laptop lid is closed; they can quarantine network and schedule a sandbox run remotely over LAN.\n7) Training mode: Using PayloadsAllTheThings samples in a lab, manim produces an animated timeline of a simulated phish and the system’s defenses for internal training.\n\nScalability and Extensibility:\n- Add tools by MCP contract; run multiple detonators in parallel containers; OSINT providers pluggable; ML retrain pipelines are local and incremental.\n\nLimitations and Mitigations:\n- No hack‑back: Attribution stays within legal OSINT and passive canaries; we never exploit or strike external systems.\n- Encrypted payloads may evade static rules: Sandbox + behavior model reduces risk.\n- Kernel‑level stealth malware may hide: This design is user‑space; for high‑assurance, consider optional eBPF probes later.\n- Public API rate limits: Cache results locally and prioritize providers.",
  "innovation_analysis": "Innovation score: 8.5/10. Uncommon synthesis: MCP as a local security tool plane, Docker as a zero‑trust detonator, Flutter as a SOC‑grade console, Mermaid for live attack graphs, and a minimal TF behavioral model—plus the clever repurposing of PayloadsAllTheThings and CamPishingBot for detection/decoy. Immediate next steps: (1) Scaffold MCP Orchestrator with security-sensor and docker-detonator; (2) Implement TF autoencoder training on 48h baseline; (3) Build Flutter console with Mermaid WebView and incident bundles; (4) Add 3 OSINT providers via public-apis; (5) Port 20 high‑value rules from PayloadsAllTheThings. Metrics: FP rate on benign processes, median sandbox verdict time, OSINT attribution accuracy, user triage time, incident bundle completeness. Tools/frameworks: modelcontextprotocol/servers, moby/moby, tensorflow/tensorflow (or TFLite), flutter/flutter, mermaid-js/mermaid, swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings, public-apis/public-apis, (optional) 3b1b/manim and abi/screenshot-to-code for reports/decoys.",
