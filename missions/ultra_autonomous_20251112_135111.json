  "refined_goal": "Design and implement an ethical red/blue-team orchestration platform that safely emulates phishing- and attacker-style behaviors, measures blue-team visibility and response, and continuously verifies detections in ephemeral sandboxes. The system combines: Ontrack for deterministic pipelines; Trickest CLI for adversary workflow graphs; Kali Intelligence Suite for OSINT-driven pretext signals (synthetic, never targeting real victims); fog-google to provision isolated GCP sandboxes; Postgres + go-pq-cdc to event-stream detections; GHAS→Jira for ticketing; Healthchecks for liveness telemetry; and AIRTBench-inspired notebooks as reproducible scenario scripts. Success criteria: 1) <5 min sandbox spin-up, 2) >=80% coverage of selected ATT&CK (Initial Access, Discovery, Exfil emulations) with zero actual exploitation, 3) MTTA/MTTR tracked and reduced by 30% over 90 days, 4) deterministic replay of scenarios with identical telemetry, 5) blue-team dashboard with SLA compliance. Why it matters: it turns adversary emulation into a repeatable, governed CI/CD for defenses—training humans and validating controls without risking production.",
  "repository_synergy": "THE INSIGHT: Instead of treating red-team exercises as handcrafted events, we treat them as release trains. We borrow the rigor of software delivery (Ontrack) and the composability of security workflows (Trickest CLI) to execute controlled, synthetic adversary behaviors. We capture ground truth into Postgres and broadcast it as a real-time stream via go-pq-cdc. We then provision, observe, and retire the environment itself (fog-google + Healthchecks) as a first-class artifact. AIRTBench’s notebook style gives us reproducible scenario blueprints; KaliIntelligenceSuite feeds safe, synthetic OSINT context that makes simulations realistic without risking outreach to real users or assets. GHAS→Jira closes the loop by translating findings into work. \n\nWHY THESE REPOS: \n- nemerosa/ontrack brings a proven, CI-grade orchestration and promotion model with Docker/Helm support—perfect for controlled red-team pipelines and approvals. \n- trickest/trickest-cli provides an expressive workflow runner purpose-built for security tasks—ideal for chaining OSINT, scanning, and telemetry generation into auditable, idempotent jobs. \n- chopicalqui/KaliIntelligenceSuite (KIS) aggregates intelligence tooling on Kali; we constrain it to safe, synthetic targets to produce realistic but harmless signals (e.g., decoy domains, open-source data stubs). \n- fog/fog-google creates ephemeral, isolated GCP resources with code—burner projects, VPCs, and instances—so all emulations run outside production. \n- Trendyol/go-pq-cdc streams Postgres changes reliably; that turns our result tables into a live event bus without additional brokers. \n- github/ghas-jira-integration is a ready-made bridge to Jira; we reuse its pattern to file tickets when detections or gaps appear. \n- healthchecks/dashboard is a lightweight, elegant status view to ensure probes, sandboxes, and pipelines are alive. \n- dreadnode/AIRTBench-Code inspires an agent/notebook harness, so scenarios are portable and reviewable, not opaque scripts. \n- esp-cpp/esp-box-emu and o7-machinehum/flipper-blackhat-os serve as an IoT/RF simulation lab seed: we don’t execute live RF exploits; we replay safe, synthetic device events for monitoring pipeline validation. \n- dynawo/dynawo, while a power-system simulator, contributes a mindset: model complex, time-varying state transitions. We mirror this by expressing kill-chain state transitions as solvable scenarios with controlled inputs/outputs—treating defensive validation as a dynamic system, not a one-off script. \n\nTHE SYNERGY: Ontrack governs scenario lifecycles, Trickest runs the security graphs, fog-google spins up the battleground, KIS provides realistic context, AIRTBench notebooks document and replay actions, Postgres captures ground truth, go-pq-cdc streams it to consumers, Healthchecks validates liveness, and GHAS→Jira ensures actionable follow-through. The innovation is a defense CI/CD that fuses orchestration, reproducibility, and safe realism—turning red-team creativity into blue-team muscle memory. \n\nTHE BRIDGE: We containerize each capability and wire them with standard interfaces: Ontrack stages invoke Trickest CLI containers; Trickest writes canonical JSON to Postgres; go-pq-cdc streams rows to a webhook that uses GHAS→Jira patterns; fog-google Ruby runs in an orchestrated container that creates/tears down resources; AIRTBench notebooks run headless to produce the exact same telemetry every time; Healthchecks gets pings from every micro-step for deterministic timing.",
  "technical_architecture": "Core components and flow:\n\n1) Control Plane (governance & orchestration)\n- Ontrack (Kotlin) is the primary orchestrator. Pipelines define Campaigns (sets of scenarios) and Exercises (single scenario execution) with promotion gates for safety: Plan → Provision → Emulate → Observe → Validate → Tear-down.\n- Each stage runs as a containerized job. Ontrack’s Docker/Helm support standardizes deployment artifacts for the sandbox and runners.\n\n2) Sandbox Provisioner (isolation & reproducibility)\n- fog-google runs inside a Ruby container. Given an Ontrack-provided, signed config, it provisions a fresh GCP project (or folder-scoped project), a dedicated VPC/subnets, firewall policies, and minimal Compute Engine instances for collectors/decoys. \n- All resources are tagged and labeled with the Exercise ID for auto-teardown and audit trails. No peering to production networks; egress restricted to allowlist (artifact and telemetry endpoints). Healthchecks receives a provisioned ping.\n\n3) Scenario Engine (reproducible, safe emulation)\n- AIRTBench-style Jupyter notebooks are executed headless (papermill or similar) to drive scenario logic (e.g., generate synthetic email telemetry, mimic discovery via harmless local commands on decoys, produce benign exfil patterns like randomized dummy files without sensitive data). \n- trickest-cli executes the supporting security workflow graphs: OSINT (KIS against synthetic targets), link/attachment safety tests against the decoys, and telemetry generation tasks. Output is canonical JSON/CSV written to a Postgres instance inside the sandbox VPC.\n- No real phishing or exploitation is executed. Scenarios are deterministic data generators and benign behavior emulators designed to mimic signals without performing unauthorized actions.\n\n4) Telemetry & Eventing (truth and streams)\n- Postgres stores structured outputs: scenario_steps, detections_expected, detections_observed, environment_state, SLA_timings. \n- go-pq-cdc attaches to a logical replication slot to stream filtered changes (e.g., new detections_observed rows) to downstream HTTP consumers within the control plane. Only whitelisted tables/columns are streamed.\n- A small webhook service (container) consumes CDC and applies GHAS→Jira integration patterns to create or update issues, map severities, and attach artifacts. It also pings Healthchecks for heartbeat of the stream.\n\n5) Blue-Team Integration & Visibility\n- healthchecks/dashboard displays: sandbox provision heartbeats, Trickest job progress, CDC liveness, and Ontrack stage checkpoints. \n- Ontrack UI becomes the canonical view of Campaigns/Exercises, artifacts, and promotion results.\n- Jira issues (via the GHAS integration style) track gaps, regressions, and SLAs for response actions.\n\nKey technical choices and justifications:\n- Ontrack over generic CI: promotion gates and release-like modeling map cleanly to ethical approval workflows and post-exercise promotion (i.e., making a scenario part of the baseline regression suite). \n- Trickest CLI: purpose-built for security workflows; allows chaining and parameterization of known tools while maintaining reproducibility and audit logs.\n- Postgres + go-pq-cdc: avoids standing up a heavy message broker; leverages CDC semantics for exactly-once-ish delivery with back-pressure handled at the DB level.\n- fog-google: Ruby API that simplifies ephemeral infra control with tagging; containerized for portability.\n- AIRTBench notebooks: blend human-readable documentation and code, producing the same telemetry on every run; supports test reviews and approvals.\n\nPerformance and optimizations:\n- Pre-bake GCP images for decoy/collector nodes to cut Provision time below 2 minutes. \n- Cache OSINT lookups for synthetic targets; KIS runs with local data stores to avoid external rate limits. \n- Use CDC column filters to restrict payload size; batch HTTP pushes from go-pq-cdc consumer for throughput. \n- Parallelize Trickest subgraphs where safe; cap concurrency to avoid noisy neighbor effects in shared sandboxes.\n\nSafety controls:\n- All exercises require Ontrack approval and run in isolated GCP projects with strict egress. \n- No execution of destructive or real-world phishing actions; only synthetic datasets and benign command traces are generated. \n- Signed configs and immutable logs stored in Postgres; scenario artifacts kept for audit and replay.\n\nIntegration patterns:\n- Contract-first schemas for scenario outputs; notebooks and Trickest jobs adhere to a shared JSON schema. \n- Healthchecks pings embedded in every job start/finish for precise timing; Ontrack and Healthchecks together provide liveness and SLOs. \n- GHAS→Jira style mapping centralizes ticket creation and deduplication across exercises.",
  "expected_impact": "Use cases uniquely enabled by this combination:\n\n1) Safe Phishing Readiness Drills: Run a Campaign that generates synthetic email and link telemetry on decoys, validating secure email gateways, SIEM parsing, and analyst triage flows—without sending real emails to users. Jira tickets open automatically on missed detections. \n\n2) Ransomware Response Lab (benign): In an isolated sandbox, emulate non-destructive ransomware behaviors (file rename patterns, fake encryption markers) derived from open-source studies to validate EDR rules and backup workflows. No real encryption is performed; only synthetic signals. \n\n3) OSINT-to-Detection Validation: Use KIS with synthetic organization profiles to test whether blue-team playbooks correctly process external-threat context (e.g., domain impersonation lookups) and correlate to internal telemetry. \n\n4) Ephemeral GCP Decoy Environments: Provision tagged, time-boxed projects that serve as trap/signal generators, verify firewall and logging baselines, and then auto-teardown with artifact preservation. \n\n5) IoT/RF Monitoring Dry Runs: With esp-box-emu and flipper-blackhat-os used purely as reference/signal templates, emit harmless device-event patterns to check RF/IoT monitoring pipelines, without transmitting unauthorized radio signals. \n\n6) CI for Detections: Ontrack promotes a scenario to the baseline suite; every code/config change to detections or logging runs the scenario, streams outcomes via CDC, and fails the pipeline if regressions appear. \n\n7) Executive Readiness Scoreboard: Healthchecks and Ontrack timings produce MTTA/MTTR and coverage metrics by Campaign; Jira SLAs show remediation velocity. \n\nScalability and extensibility:\n- Add scenarios by authoring new AIRTBench notebooks and Trickest graphs; Ontrack picks them up as new Exercises. \n- Postgres+CDC scales horizontally by sharding scenarios across multiple DBs. \n- fog-google templates support multi-region sandboxes with identical guardrails. \n\nLimitations and mitigations:\n- Tooling heterogeneity (Kotlin, Ruby, Go, Python) increases operational complexity—mitigated by containerization and a thin contract-first schema. \n- fog-google quotas and GCP project creation limits—mitigate via preallocated projects in a pool. \n- Trickest CLI external dependency and rate limits—prefer local/offline synthetic datasets; throttle concurrency. \n- Ethical constraints—hard-coded safety gates, environment isolation, and mandatory approvals in Ontrack; no real-world targeting or exploitation.",
  "innovation_analysis": "Innovation score: 8.5/10. This design reframes adversary emulation as a disciplined, reproducible delivery pipeline—leveraging Ontrack, Trickest, and CDC to turn red-team creativity into measurable, continuous defense validation. \n\nImmediate next steps:\n1) Stand up Ontrack and define the core pipeline skeleton (Plan→Provision→Emulate→Validate→Teardown). \n2) Build a fog-google container to provision/tear down a minimal sandbox and ping Healthchecks. \n3) Deploy Postgres with a basic schema; wire go-pq-cdc to a simple webhook that logs events. \n4) Author one AIRTBench-style notebook + Trickest graph that generates purely synthetic phishing telemetry and writes to Postgres. \n5) Configure GHAS→Jira mapping to open a test issue on a missing detection event. \n\nKey metrics:\n- Sandbox provision time, scenario execution duration, CDC end-to-end latency, detection coverage %, MTTA/MTTR deltas, and replay determinism rate. \n\nEssential tools/frameworks:\n- Ontrack, trickest-cli, fog-google, Trendyol/go-pq-cdc, healthchecks/dashboard, GHAS→Jira integration, Postgres, container runtime (Docker/Helm). \n\nNote: All activities are for authorized, isolated environments and training only; no real phishing or unauthorized access is performed.",

The code is intended as a proof-of-concept, showing the basic operations necessary to handle incoming requests from GitHub. Please feel free to use this as a starting point for your own integration.\n\n## Using the GitHub Action\n\nThe easiest way to use this tool is via its GitHub Action, which you can add to your workflows. Here is what you need before you can start:\n\n* A GitHub repository with Code Scanning enabled and a few alerts. Follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/finding-security-vulnerabilities-and-errors-in-your-code/setting-up-code-scanning-for-a-repository) to set up Code Scanning.\n* The URL of your Jira Server instance.\n* A [Jira project](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/creating-a-project-938846813.html) to store your issues. You will need to provide its `project key` to the action. (Must be Scrum project type; Kanban will not work.)\n* A Jira Server account (username + password) with the following permissions for the abovementioned project:\n  * `Browse Projects`\n  * `Close Issues`\n  * `Create Issues`\n  * `Delete Issues`\n  * `Edit Issues`\n  * `Transition Issues`\n* Depending on where you run your workflow, the Jira Server instance must be accessible from either the [GitHub.com IP addresses](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/about-githubs-ip-addresses) or the address of your GitHub Enterprise Server instance.\n\nMake sure you safely store all credentials as [GitHub Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/acti",
