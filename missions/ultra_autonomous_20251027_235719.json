  "refined_goal": "Design and deploy a resilient, user-owned PC protection stack that: 1) hardens your network edge with a Raspberry Pi–based transparent bridge capable of immediate hardware isolation, 2) instrument your PC to capture phishing/ intrusion artifacts, 3) automatically enrich those artifacts via curated public threat APIs, and 4) probabilistically trace attacker infrastructure paths using a repurposed propagation engine. Concretely: build a stable-pi-core–based sentinel bridge with PlatformIO-driven hardware kill-switch, a PC agent that streams indicators to the sentinel, an OSINT pipeline bootstrapped from public-apis/public-apis, and an offline backtracer that adapts CRPropa3’s Monte Carlo propagation to internet AS topologies. Success means: sub-2s block on malicious domains/IPs, <1% false positives over 30 days, audited backtraces for at least 60% of unique campaigns, and operator awareness boosted via Reach-based audio cues. This matters because it makes attribution-oriented defense practical at home scale.",
  "repository_synergy": "THE INSIGHT: None of these repos is a typical security product—and that’s the opportunity. Public-apis/public-apis is a living map of free OSINT endpoints; platformio-core is a way to turn any microcontroller into part of your security fabric; stable-pi-core is the substrate for a rock-solid, minimal OS; CRPropa3 models particle propagation with fields and stochastic scatter; Reach is a creative, low-latency DSP engine. Brought together, they yield a home/SMB defense that not only blocks threats but also reconstructs where they likely came from—then communicates risk intuitively.\n\nTHE STORY: Why these, not the obvious IDS/EDR stacks? Because we want portability, explainability, and cost transparency without vendor lock-in.\n- public-apis/public-apis: Instead of pre-baking costly intel feeds, we harvest a curated, community-vetted catalog to auto-wire free or freemium reputation services (abuse reporting, DNS, URL scanning). The repo is our API discovery layer.\n- platformio/platformio-core: Security hardening often fails at the last mile—when you need to physically sever the link. PlatformIO lets us quickly compile firmware for a tiny MCU relay linked to the Pi. When policy triggers, the network drops in milliseconds—no kernel stall, no process hang.\n- KOSASIH/stable-pi-core: A Pi is perfect as an inline transparent bridge, but only if it’s stable and reproducible. This repo anchors the image, services, and configuration ethos to keep the sentinel deterministic and auto-recovering.\n- CRPropa/CRPropa3: Attack attribution is like inferring a source in a noisy medium. CRPropa’s core competence—stochastic propagation in structured fields—is surprisingly aligned with modeling internet path likelihoods through AS-level “fields,” exit nodes, fast-flux CDNs, and resolver “magnetizations.” We translate routing biases into fields and treat redirect chains as scatter.\n- Sinuslabs/Reach: Security UIs overwhelm. Reach lets us sonify risk states with timbre and decay that the brain parses instantly. A sharp transient for a new IOC, a long tail for persistent campaigns—zero learning curve, instant attention.\n\nTHE SYNERGY: The Pi sentinel becomes a programmable edge: hard network policy plus a dynamic OSINT brain harvested from the public-apis list. The MCU adds a hardware final say. CRPropa3 turns your evidence chain into a probabilistic origin map, turning raw logs into investigative momentum. Reach turns alerts into instantly meaningful sound sketches.\n\nTHE INNOVATION: This is not just blocking. It’s attribution-oriented home defense. You don’t merely stop a phishing link—you collect headers, redirects, resolver footprints, and then simulate likely infrastructure origins while feeding abuse desks with precise, documented reports. The novelty is using a physics propagation engine for cyber backtracing and treating a Pi as a composable enforcement plus enrichment hub.\n\nTHE BRIDGE: We build a “Public APIs Harvester” that scrapes/ingests the public-apis list, auto-generates connectors, and activates a short list of security endpoints. The Pi runs a transparent bridge configured via stable-pi-core; an attached MCU built with platformio-core controls a relay on the Ethernet line. Events from the PC agent flow to the Pi; a CRPropa3 sidecar ingests graph data and produces origin likelihoods; Reach powers a tiny web UI with distinctive audio cues tied to policy state. The result: a cohesive, low-dependency, high-agency defense lattice.",
  "technical_architecture": "Components\n- PC Agent (Python): Hooks into OS event sources (browser download directory monitor, DNS cache query watcher, mail client EML export folder, system firewall logs) and normalizes artifacts: URLs, domains, IPs, file hashes, email headers. Sends to Sentinel over gRPC with TLS.\n- Sentinel Bridge (Raspberry Pi): Built on KOSASIH/stable-pi-core principles for a reproducible, stable image. Operates as a transparent L2 bridge (br0 over eth0/eth1) with nftables for policy. Includes:\n  - Enrichment Service: Uses an auto-generated registry from public-apis/public-apis to call selected OSINT endpoints (e.g., AbuseIPDB, urlscan.io, ipinfo, PhishTank) based on credentials present in a secrets vault. Caches reputations with TTL-aware backoff.\n  - Policy Engine: Real-time decisions (allow/quarantine/block) on flows, updating nftables sets. Triggers MCU relay on critical state.\n  - Event Bus: Local NATS or ZeroMQ channel for decoupling producers (PC Agent, Bridge Tap) and consumers (Enrich, Policy, CRPropa Sidecar, UI). If minimalism preferred, use UNIX domain sockets.\n  - Bridge Tap: Parses netfilter queue samples for suspect flows (SNI, DoH endpoints, DNS packets) without full DPI.\n- Hardware Kill-Switch (MCU): ESP32/STM32 running firmware built with platformio-core. Controls a relay inline with the PC’s Ethernet patch or a powered USB Ethernet adapter. UART to Pi for commands, hardware watchdog for fail-safe default to open or closed per policy.\n- Backtrace Sidecar (CRPropa3): Standalone process using CRPropa3 C++ libs via a CLI wrapper. Input: redirect graph, observed resolver IPs, TTL patterns, ASN path candidates (from public API data, e.g., Team Cymru IP-to-ASN via listed APIs), and timing jitter. Model: AS graph as a field; CDNs/fast-flux as high-scatter regions; exit nodes as sources with priors. Output: posterior over origin ASNs and infrastructure clusters with confidence intervals.\n- UI + Sonification (Reach): Web UI served by the Sentinel. Uses Sinuslabs/Reach’s DSP to generate earcons: short bright impulses for high-confidence malicious IOCs, mellow decays for quarantined events, and evolving reverbs for ongoing campaigns. Visual panes for flow state, enrichment results, and backtrace map overlays.\n\nKey Flows\n1) Artifact ingest: PC Agent -> gRPC -> Sentinel Event Bus -> Enrichment -> Policy -> nftables sets + MCU state.\n2) Edge observation: Bridge Tap -> Event Bus -> Enrichment (as needed) -> Policy.\n3) Backtrace: Enriched IOC bundle -> CRPropa3 Sidecar -> Origin likelihood report -> UI.\n4) Abuse reporting: Enrichment -> API connectors (from public-apis list) to submit abuse tickets (when available), with opt-in.\n\nAPIs/Interfaces\n- gRPC with TLS for PC<->Sentinel. Protobuf schema: Artifact, EnrichmentResult, PolicyDecision, BacktraceReport.\n- MCU control: UART at fixed baud with simple CBOR messages: {cmd: CUT|RESTORE|PING, reason, ttl}.\n- Enrichment connectors: HTTPS REST; consolidated by parsing public-apis list (YAML/Markdown) to preselect Security, Anti-Malware, Geolocation categories; wrapper enforces timeouts, retries, and rate-limits.\n\nPerformance and Optimizations\n- Caching: IOC reputation cache keyed by normalized indicator + versioned source, with negative caching to avoid storming APIs.\n- Sampling: Only mirror initial packets of new TCP flows; leverage SNI for TLS domains without full TLS interception.\n- Set-based filtering: nftables named sets for domains/IPs enable O(1) policy checks.\n- Asynchrony: Event bus prevents UI/Policy lockups under load.\n- Isolation and Licensing: CRPropa3 and Reach are GPL-3.0. To avoid copyleft obligations for the whole stack, run them as separate processes with file/IPC boundaries and clearly separated distribution, keeping the core policy agent permissively licensed.",
  "expected_impact": "Use Cases\n1) Click-time interdiction: When a user clicks a suspicious link, the PC Agent extracts the URL, the Sentinel enriches via public APIs, and if high-risk, adds the domain to an nftables set within 1–2 seconds; the MCU cuts the link if a payload attempt is already underway.\n2) Email header forensics to backtrace: User saves phishing EML; the Agent parses Received headers, nameservers, and links. CRPropa3 computes likely origin AS clusters, accounting for fast-flux nodes as scatter. The UI shows a ranked origin map and prefilled abuse contacts.\n3) Safe sandboxed follow: Operator opens a phishing URL behind the Sentinel; it appends a unique, non-invasive tag and records the redirect chain, achieving a complete infrastructure map without executing payloads.\n4) DNS hardening with graceful UX: Sentinel detects sudden resolver changes or DoH to unknown endpoints; it alerts with a distinct Reach earcon and blocks until user confirms, reducing silent hijacks.\n5) Reporting loop: Enriched IOCs auto-generate reports to AbuseIPDB or equivalent APIs from public-apis; receipts and rate-limits are tracked in the UI.\n6) Family/SMB mode: Profiles enforce stricter rules and automatic cutoffs during off-hours; audio cues make it obvious when risky activity hits.\n7) Travel mode: Sentinel Pi + MCU travels with you; policies and caches sync from home, giving consistent protection on untrusted networks.\n\nScalability and Extensibility\n- Horizontal: Multiple PCs report to one Sentinel; nftables sets handle aggregate IOC size. The cache reduces API load.\n- Extensible: Add new OSINT connectors by re-parsing public-apis upstream list on schedule; no code changes needed for many.\n\nLimitations and Mitigations\n- HTTPS payload visibility is limited: rely on SNI and metadata; avoid full TLS interception to preserve privacy and simplicity.\n- Backtrace confidence: CRPropa3 provides probabilistic inference; present confidence bands and never assert identity.\n- API rate limits: Employ caching, exponential backoff; allow local-only mode during outages.\n- Hardware dependency: MCU relay requires build and wiring; offer a software-only fallback with router-integrated blocking.",
  "innovation_analysis": "Innovation score: 8.5/10. The unconventional reuse of CRPropa3 for cyber backtracing, combined with a stable Pi bridge, PlatformIO-driven hardware cut-off, and auto-harvested OSINT from public-apis, creates a uniquely attribution-aware home defense.\n\nNext steps\n1) Stand up the Sentinel bridge with stable-pi-core conventions; validate nftables policy path.\n2) Build the Public APIs Harvester to auto-generate connectors for 3–5 key endpoints; implement caching.\n3) Implement the MCU relay firmware with platformio-core and wire UART control.\n4) Build the gRPC schema and PC Agent for URL/domain/hash/header ingest.\n5) Prototype CRPropa3 sidecar: define AS-graph field mapping and run small Monte Carlo tests on real phishing samples.\n6) Add Reach-based alert sounds and a minimal web UI.\n\nMetrics\n- Time-to-block (median, p95).\n- False positive rate on known-good sites.\n- IOC enrichment coverage and latency.\n- Backtrace origin confidence and validation rate.\n- Mean time to hardware cut on critical events.\n\nEssential tools/frameworks\n- platformio-core CLI for MCU builds.\n- stable-pi-core setup for Pi imaging/config.\n- CRPropa3 compiled as a standalone sidecar.\n- public-apis list parser to seed OSINT modules.\n- Sinuslabs/Reach for web-based DSP alerts.",
