  "refined_goal": "Build a local-first, adversary-aware PC defense and attribution stack that does three things exceptionally well: (1) neutralizes phishing before it lands by decoding Unicode/typographic deception (homoglyphs, glyph-substitution in PDFs) using fonttools; (2) correlates host telemetry (filesystem, login attempts, browser clicks) into an attack graph you can traverse like a star map; and (3) performs lawful OSINT to identify the sending infrastructure behind attacks. The stack centers on a Falcon Python microservice, Node/TS agents using ofetch + arecibo for telemetry, LLM-assisted enrichment via microsoft/UFO, and a Postgres log lake tuned with digoal/blog guidance. Success means: >98% detection of Unicode homograph domains with <0.1% false positives; <3s MTTD for high-severity events; 95% precision on “likely phishing” classification; and a one-click provider-level attribution report. Why it matters: it closes the gap between prevention and explainable, defensible attribution on a single PC without cloud lock-in.",
  "repository_synergy": "The insight: phishing operations increasingly exploit typography and context, not just malware. The repos hint at a cross-domain lens: what if we treat your PC like a robot with sensors, visualize threats like a space map, and use typography tooling to dismantle deception? The bridge is surprising but effective.\n\nWhy these repos:\n- fonttools/fonttools gives us superpowers against visual deception—programmatically inspect fonts in PDFs/HTML, map glyphs to code points, and score confusables to block homoglyph domains pre-click. Most EDRs ignore typography; we weaponize it.\n- falconry/falcon is a lean, high-performance Python API layer—perfect for a local microservice that accepts telemetry, runs analyzers, and returns decisions with millisecond overhead.\n- unjs/ofetch + ducktors/arecibo form a nimble Node/TS agent stack for fetching, sending, and buffering telemetry from local sensors to the Falcon core with backpressure and retries.\n- microsoft/UFO (OpenAI-oriented orchestration) lets us impose structured, deterministic LLM workflows for classification and IOC extraction with strong guardrails—LLM as an extractor, not an oracle.\n- AndrejOrsula/space_robotics_bench reframes monitoring as missions: episodic runs across diverse sensors with coverage metrics, making scanning schedules measurable and improvable.\n- endless-sky/endless-sky contributes an intuitive metaphor and asset/event loop patterns for navigating complex graphs. We adapt its spatial navigation concepts to render attack graphs: domains, IPs, processes as star systems and hyperlanes.\n- digoal/blog (PostgreSQL mastery) informs a log lake that’s fast and durable under bursty write loads: partitioning, index discipline, and retention strategies.\n- catppuccin/nvim + jdhao/nvim-config + unixorn/awesome-zsh-plugins translate detection into a developer-native experience: suspicious strings glow in your editor and shell, guiding safe refactors and secure ops.\n- Greedysky/TTKMusicPlayer is our unexpected sensor: an audio engine adapted to detect ultrasonic C2 beacons or inaudible tracking sounds (rare but real) and to deliver crisp, local alerts without external dependencies.\n- ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet provides a universal micro-UI language: clear, compact status glyphs for notifications and CLI.\n- milahu/alchi (mirror indexes) anchors supply-chain hygiene: lock and mirror key artifacts, ensuring the defense doesn’t become a new risk.\n- neetcode-gh/leetcode reminds us to systematize algorithmics: dynamic programming-ish correlation across events, fast set intersections, and graph search patterns for attribution.\n\nThe synergy: fonttools eliminates typographic fog; Falcon glues analyzers into a predictable API; ofetch + arecibo deliver frictionless cross-language telemetry; UFO marshals LLMs into typed outputs; robotics-bench patterns give us mission planning; endless-sky provides a mental and visual model to traverse complex relations. Together, we don’t just block; we produce defensible, explainable provenance: \"This email used a Cyrillic ‘а’ in ‘pаypal.com’, delivered via ASN X, DKIM-signed by Y, link resolved to cloud host Z.\" That’s new: prevention and principled attribution, running privately on your PC.",
  "technical_architecture": "Components and flow:\n1) Sensor Agents (local):\n- Email/Document analyzer (Python): hooks a mail client or watches a Downloads/Attachments folder; extracts URLs, text, and embedded fonts (PDF/HTML). Uses fonttools to map glyphs to code points, compute UTS#39 confusability scores, and flag glyph-substitution in fonts. Emits a normalized event (JSON) to the Telemetry Gateway.\n- Browser click proxy (optional system proxy or extension): captures domain/URL metadata; punycode normalization and WHOIS/CT lookups via ofetch to local Falcon endpoints (no external traffic unless configured).\n- Auth and system logs watcher: tails Windows ETW/Sysmon or Linux journal for login attempts, process starts, and network connections. Emits events with hashes, user, IP, and geo hints.\n- Audio sentinel: embeds a minimal TTKMusicPlayer pipeline to sample output spectrum (16–22 kHz), detect persistent narrowband energy patterns, and flag potential ultrasonic beacons. All processing is local.\n- Shell/Editor integrations: zsh prompt plugin and Neovim Lua plugin that call the Falcon API to inline risk annotations for pasted URLs, git commit diffs, or scripts.\n\n2) Telemetry Gateway (Node/TS):\n- arecibo for resilient buffering, local persistence, and backoff.\n- ofetch for request orchestration to the Core API. Batch events to reduce syscall pressure.\n- Signed local JWT to authenticate against the Core.\n\n3) Core API (Python/Falcon):\n- /v1/events/ingest: accepts sensor batches; validates schema; writes to Postgres (JSONB + partitions). Applies streaming enrichers (punycode -> Unicode, ASN lookup via offline DBs, SPF/DKIM/DMARC parsers).\n- /v1/analyze/url and /v1/analyze/document: fonttools-driven heuristics for homoglyphs and font-embedded attack patterns; returns score + rationale.\n- /v1/llm/extract: microsoft/UFO pipeline with a system prompt that converts raw text into typed IOC bundles (domains, emails, infra hints) with confidence and citations. Output is JSONSchema-validated.\n- /v1/graph: builds attack graphs in-memory (networkx) from recent events; returns a compact graph for visualization.\n\n4) Data Layer (PostgreSQL):\n- Tables: events_raw (partitioned by day), ioc_extracted, findings, osint_cache. JSONB columns with GIN indexes; narrow composite indexes on ts, type, host.\n- digoal/blog-inspired patterns: time-based partitioning, logical replication optional for backup, autovacuum tuning for high-ingest.\n\n5) Visualization:\n- Electron-lite (optional) or Web UI served by Falcon. The attack graph uses endless-sky-like navigation: zoomable map of indicators (stars) and edges (lanes) colored by risk and freshness. Emojis annotate nodes (🧵 for thread, 🧪 for sandbox, 🚫 for block).\n\nKey challenges and solutions:\n- Unicode/typography evasion: Use fonttools to compute per-string confusability, compare against registered domain labels, and detect font-level glyph remaps in PDFs.\n- Local-first OSINT: Provide offline-capable enrichers (public suffix list, ASN DB, GeoLite). Optionally burst to cloud APIs via a proxy with rate limits.\n- LLM determinism: Use UFO to force structured outputs, temperature=0, and toolformer-like extraction. Never auto-apply destructive actions; findings require policy gates.\n- Performance: Batch inserts; JSONB + GIN for IOC lookups; asynchronous enrichers; watchdog threads for backpressure to Gateway; ring buffers in audio sentinel. Optimize critical paths in Cython where needed.\n- Safety/legal: No hacking back. Attribution produces provider-level context (ASN, hosting, registrars), not personal identities. Actions limited to local blocklists and abuse desk report templates.",
  "expected_impact": "Use cases:\n1) Pre-click domain defense: You paste a URL in your terminal. The zsh plugin queries the Core; fonttools detects a Cyrillic ‘е’ in ‘facеbook.com’, returns risk=high with rationale. The shell warns and offers to open a safe WHOIS/CT report instead.\n2) PDF invoice trap: A vendor PDF lands in Downloads. The document analyzer extracts embedded fonts and finds a custom glyph mapping digit ‘1’ to a lookalike ‘l’ used in an IBAN field. The UI flags the PDF and shows a diff rendering of real vs deceptive glyphs.\n3) RDP brute-force probe: ETW logs show repeated login attempts from rotating IPs. The graph view fuses attempts with passive DNS, clustering them to an ASN; it generates an abuse report email template pre-filled with evidence and timestamps.\n4) Living-off-the-land script: A PowerShell snippet in a commit diff gets auto-annotated in Neovim with risk emojis and a “known LOLBIN pattern” link. You click to open a local playbook with safe remediation steps.\n5) Ultrasonic beacon suspicion: The audio sentinel finds a 19.2 kHz sustained tone when a certain page is open. The system correlates with a new web domain request and flags potential tracking beacons; you get an audible alert and a detailed local-only report.\n6) Post-incident timeline: After a phishing click, the attack graph shows the sequence: email source → link redirectors → final host → process spawn → registry write. You can navigate like a star map, export a signed PDF report, and rotate credentials.\n7) Supply-chain hardening: Installation pulls from mirrored dependencies; any attempt to fetch from new registries is logged and requires explicit approval.\n\nScalability/extensibility: Partitioned Postgres handles months of events; agents are pluggable; enrichers accept WebAssembly/py plugins. Limitations: fully offline attribution reduces enrichment fidelity; audio beacons are rare and may false positive—mitigated by confirmation across browsers and time windows. Kernel-level rootkits remain out of scope; rely on platform EDR or secure boot.",
  "innovation_analysis": "Innovation score: 8.8/10. The typography-first anti-phish angle, robotics-style mission scheduling, and space-map attack graph produce a uniquely explainable, local-first defense with lawful attribution. It blends practical frameworks (Falcon, ofetch, Postgres) with unexpected repurposing (fonttools for deception, TTK audio sensing) and LLMs as constrained extractors, not decision makers.\n\nNext steps (2 weeks):\n- Day 1–2: Scaffold Falcon API, schemas, Postgres partitions; seed zcf-based TS agent using arecibo + ofetch.\n- Day 3–6: Implement fonttools analyzers (homoglyph scoring, PDF font remap detection); write unit tests with synthetic samples.\n- Day 7–9: Wire UFO LLM extraction with JSONSchema validation; add offline enrichers (PSL, ASN DB).\n- Day 10–12: Build zsh/Neovim integrations; basic graph UI.\n- Day 13–14: Benchmarks, false-positive tuning; abuse-report exporter.\n\nMetrics: homograph detection precision/recall; MTTD; ingest throughput; LLM extraction accuracy vs gold; OSINT cache hit ratio; user-time-to-decision. Tools: Python 3.11, Falcon, fonttools, Postgres, Node 20, ofetch, arecibo, UFO, networkx, JSONSchema, eBPF/ETW readers, Neovim Lua, zsh.",

Use your earnings to buy a better ship or to upgrade the weapons and engines on your current one. Blow up pirates. Take sides in a civil war. Or leave human space behind and hope to find some friendly aliens whose culture is more civilized than your own...\n\n------\n\nEndless Sky is a sandbox-style space exploration game similar to Elite, Escape Velocity, or Star Control. You start out as the captain of a tiny spaceship and can choose what to do from there. The game includes a major plot line and many minor missions, but you can choose whether you want to play through the plot or strike out on your own as a merchant or bounty hunter or explorer.\n\nSee the [player's manual](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/PlayersManual) for more information, or the [home page](https://endless-sky.github.io/) for screenshots and the occasional blog post.\n\n## Installing the game\n\nOfficial releases of Endless Sky are available as direct downloads from [GitHub](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/releases/latest), on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/404410/Endless_Sky/), on [GOG](https://gog.com/game/endless_sky), and on [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.github.endless_sky.endless_sky). Other package managers may also include the game, though the specific version provided may not be up-to-date.\n\n## System Requirements\n\nEndless Sky has very minimal system requirements, meaning most systems should be able to run the game.

Falcon cuts to the chase with a\nclean design that embraces HTTP and the REST architectural style.\n\nFalcon apps work with any `WSGI <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/>`_\nor `ASGI <https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ server, and run like a\nchamp under CPython 3.9+ and PyPy 3.9+.\n\nQuick Links\n-----------\n\n* `Read the docs <https://falcon.readthedocs.io/en/stable>`_\n  (`FAQ <https://falcon.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/faq.html>`_ -\n  `getting help <https://falcon.readthedocs.io/en/stable/community/help.html>`_ -\n  `reference <https://falcon.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/index.html>`_)\n* `Falcon add-ons and complementary packages <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/wiki>`_\n* `Falcon articles, talks and podcasts <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/wiki/Articles,-Talks-and-Podcasts>`_\n* `falconry/user for Falcon users <https://gitter.im/falconry/user>`_ @ Gitter\n* `falconry/dev for Falcon contributors <https://gitter.im/falconry/dev>`_ @ Gitter\n\nWhat People are Saying\n----------------------\n\n\"Falcon is rock solid and it's fast.\"\n\n\"We have been using Falcon as a replacement for [another framework] and\nwe simply love the performance (three times faster) and code base size (easily\nhalf of our [original] code).\"\n\n\"I'm loving #falconframework! Super clean and simple, I finally\nhave the speed and flexibility I need!\"\n\n\"Falcon looks great so far.",

(now you can call me a pessimist.)\n\n## packages\n\nthis repository is organized as a monorepo of multiple packages\n\n* [src/whoaremyfriends/](src/whoaremyfriends/)\n* [src/alchi-book/](src/alchi-book/) - old version of `src/whoaremyfriends/`\n* [src/alchi-flyer/](src/alchi-flyer/)\n* [src/alchi-types/](src/alchi-types/)\n* [src/alchi-maps/](src/alchi-maps/)\n* [src/alchi-test/](src/alchi-test/)\n\na monorepo is easier to backup, and usually our readers need all packages\n\n### releases\n\nwe try to release all our content as **single file apps**\nwhich can be simply opened in any web browser,  \nwithout [installing node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)\nand without starting a local web server\n\n[//]: # ( usually with `npm ",
