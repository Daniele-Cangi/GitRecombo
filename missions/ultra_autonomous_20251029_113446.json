  "refined_goal": "Build a self-hosted, privacy-preserving PC protection and traceback stack that: (1) blocks phishing and intrusion attempts at the host edge, (2) decoys and records attacker behavior for attribution, and (3) triages suspicious artifacts with light machine learning-driven prioritization. Concretely: use SafeLine (Go WAF) inline as a local smart proxy, frp to expose ephemeral honeypots and collect telemetry, StevenBlack/hosts to harden DNS-level blocking, a Node.js control plane (hackathon-starter + Bootstrap UI) for policy and evidence, and a Python analysis worker that leverages Triton (binary analysis), jadx (APK decompilation), and selected ctf-tools. A light ML layer (skfolio) fuses indicators into a risk score that drives automated actions. Success: block ≥90% known phishing domains pre-click, reduce mean triage time to <5 minutes, and derive reproducible IOCs to pinpoint infrastructure behind attacks. Why it matters: it transforms a single PC from a passive target into an active, evidence-producing sensor without sacrificing usability or privacy.",
  "repository_synergy": "The insight: treat your PC like a micro-sensor plus micro-honeynet. Most consumer defenses end at block/allow; they rarely produce attribution-grade evidence. By combining a WAF (SafeLine) with frp’s NAT traversal, we can safely expose decoy surfaces when needed and capture attacker behavior. Then, repurpose portfolio optimization (skfolio) as a lightweight ML fusion engine to prioritize risk across heterogeneous signals. The result is a personal defense-and-traceback loop that is unusually rich for a single endpoint.\n\nWhy these repos: SafeLine is a high-performance Go WAF with a rule engine we can deploy locally, giving us HTTP inspection and mitigation without a cloud dependency. frp gives us precise, on-demand tunnels that turn your PC into a controlled honeypot, capturing attacker metadata on your terms. StevenBlack/hosts provides a hard, low-friction DNS shield that blocks a huge tail of phishing and malware domains—even before SafeLine sees them. sahat/hackathon-starter accelerates a production-grade dashboard—auth, sessions, routes—so we can focus on security logic, while Bootstrap gives a clean operator UI. Triton is the rare open framework that supports dynamic binary analysis and symbolic execution from Python—perfect to extract IOCs from suspect binaries without shipping data elsewhere. jadx brings fast APK decompilation to demystify Android phishing droppers. zardus/ctf-tools offers an on-ramp to vetted analysis utilities (oletools, binwalk, exiftool, radare2) via one consistent interface. ohmyzsh provides an operator-friendly CLI and repeatable workflows. lucko/spark adds pragmatic, low-overhead profiling of Java processes—handy when a malware sample spins a JVM. KasperskyLab/hrtng complements reverse engineering if you already have IDA.\n\nThe synergy: SafeLine sits as a local outbound/inbound HTTP proxy, enforcing smart rules (e.g., block suspicious TLDs, inspect URIs for known phishing patterns) while StevenBlack/hosts blocks known-bad domains outright. When an intrusion is suspected (e.g., repeated credential stuffing or RDP scans detected via logs), frp spins up an ephemeral decoy service under SafeLine’s umbrella. All events—click attempts, blocked domains, honeypot hits—flow to the Node control plane. There, the skfolio-based risk layer treats each indicator as a factor and computes a normalized risk score that drives actions: quarantine, deeper analysis with Triton/jadx, or auto-block rules. The ctf-tools sandbox provides dependable, scriptable runners for one-off artifact checks without retooling.\n\nThe bridge: we integrate via thin adapters instead of inventing new systems. SafeLine exposes logs and rule updates over files or HTTP; the dashboard pulls and pushes them. frp is driven by a minimal CLI controller that the dashboard calls. The analysis worker uses Python to orchestrate Triton and jadx and to launch ctf-tools runners. ohmyzsh glues it together for power users with a consistent CLI experience. This combination lets a single machine punch above its weight: it blocks, decoys, analyzes, and attributes—locally and legally—without relying on heavyweight SIEMs or closed clouds.",
  "technical_architecture": "Components and flow:\n\n1) Edge Shield (local):\n- SafeLine (Go) runs as a local HTTP/HTTPS proxy on 127.0.0.1:8080. Outbound web traffic is routed through it via system proxy settings. For inbound decoys, SafeLine fronts specified ports as a reverse proxy to local honeypot services. Its rule engine enforces: domain/TLD allowlists, URL pattern checks, content-type gating, and body-length heuristics. It emits JSON logs.\n- StevenBlack/hosts updater (Python microservice) refreshes unified hosts lists on a schedule, merging with locally generated IOCs. It writes atomically to the hosts file and offers a dry-run mode.\n\n2) Decoy/Attribution Plane:\n- frp client (frpc) runs locally. When risk is elevated (e.g., repeated probing), the control plane asks frpc to open a short-lived public tunnel to a local decoy service (HTTP login form, fake RDP banner, etc.) that is always behind SafeLine. We tag each tunnel with a unique ID and inject a canary in the response to link later events to a specific campaign.\n- Honeypot services are minimal containers or local processes. An ultra-light default is an Express-based fake login (reusing hackathon-starter’s stack) guarded by SafeLine rules to avoid real compromise while logging IPs, headers, timings, and behavior sequences.\n\n3) Control Plane and UI:\n- sahat/hackathon-starter (Node/Express) provides auth, sessions, and routes. We add modules: Policy API (CRUD for SafeLine rules), Evidence API (event ingestion from SafeLine/frp), Actions API (start/stop frp tunnels, switch SafeLine profiles), and Analysis API (enqueue/monitor artifact analysis).\n- UI uses Bootstrap components for incident cards, risk gauges, and a traffic timeline. Operators can one-click: block domain, launch decoy, submit artifact, or export IOCs.\n- Storage: use hackathon-starter’s built-in Mongo integration or a simple local JSONL store if you prefer zero dependencies. Evidence and IOCs are append-only for auditability.\n\n4) Analysis Worker (Python):\n- Binary triage via Triton: sandboxed execution with syscall/API-hook patterns; we cap execution time and instruction count to stay light. We extract domains, IPs, registry keys, mutex names, and suspicious strings, producing IOC bundles.\n- Android triage via jadx: decompile suspected APKs; scan for hardcoded endpoints and suspicious permissions; output human-readable summaries and endpoints.\n- ctf-tools orchestrator: thin wrapper scripts to run specific tools (e.g., oletools on Office docs, exiftool for metadata) and normalize outputs to JSON.\n- Risk fusion via skfolio: treat each feature (domain age proxy, URL lexical flags, file entropy, packer flags, SafeLine rule triggers, canary hits) as a factor portfolio. We fit a simple mean-variance model per user (no PII), constraining weights and penalizing noisy factors. The resulting score in [0,1] drives automation thresholds; this is the “light ML.”\n\n5) Operator CLI:\n- ohmyzsh plugin exposes commands: pcguardian status, pcguardian block <domain>, pcguardian decoy up, pcguardian analyze <path>, pcguardian risk tail. go-cursor-help improves CLI UX (cursor visibility and clean progress handling) for long-running analyses.\n\n6) Optional specialized modules:\n- lucko/spark agent can attach to a suspicious Java PID to capture stack samples and GC/network patterns. If SafeLine flags unusual Java HTTP traffic, we trigger short sampling and surface summaries in the dashboard.\n- KasperskyLab/hrtng integration as an export: if the operator uses IDA Pro, we export artifacts in a format the plugin understands for deeper static RE.\n\nAPIs and integration:\n- SafeLine integration via its config files and HTTP endpoints (where available). The dashboard posts rule changes and tails logs via a file watcher.\n- frp controlled via its config and a process manager. Each tunnel is a typed resource with TTL and labels.\n- Analysis Worker exposes a local HTTP queue endpoint that the dashboard posts artifacts to; results are pushed back via webhook or polled.\n\nPerformance and safety:\n- All heavy analysis is opt-in and time-bounded. We default to static scans first, and only escalate to Triton symbolic steps if initial signals exceed a threshold.\n- Hosts updates are atomic and validated; we keep a rollback file.\n- SafeLine runs with conservative defaults; decoy endpoints are isolated and write-only for logs.\n- We batch risk computations; skfolio models are re-fitted nightly on local evidence to self-calibrate without external data.\n\nNon-obvious optimizations:\n- Two-phase tunnel: frp pre-reserves a port, but SafeLine only admits traffic after a 5-second warmup while canaries and correlation IDs are injected, ensuring logs tie unambiguously to the right run.\n- Rule learning-lite: when multiple incidents share newly extracted IOCs, we auto-suggest SafeLine rule patches and hosts entries with confidence scores from the portfolio weights.\n- Jadx selective decompilation: only decompile packages with network permissions; otherwise parse manifest and strings to save time.",
  "expected_impact": "Use cases:\n\n1) Click-safe browsing for high-risk links: A user receives a suspicious URL. Opening it routes via SafeLine; if pattern-triggered, the dashboard renders a risk banner. With one click, the operator opens a decoy via frp to safely observe server behavior (redirects, form logic) without touching the real browser, capturing IPs and headers for attribution.\n\n2) Inline phishing block-at-source: The unified hosts file already null-routes many phishing domains. SafeLine’s outbound proxy adds URI-level filters catching subtle lookalikes (e.g., homoglyphs or login endpoints with known bait paths). The system logs what was blocked and offers one-click allow for false positives.\n\n3) Endpoint intrusion decoy: Repeated inbound probe patterns (e.g., RDP scans observed in local logs or router alerts mirrored to the dashboard) trigger an ephemeral frp tunnel to a decoy service. The decoy records credential attempts and tooling signatures (unique User-Agent, timing). Evidence ties to a correlation ID so you can later pivot on IPs and ASNs.\n\n4) Attachment triage without cloud upload: A suspicious executable or APK is dropped into a watched folder. The analysis worker runs Triton/jadx and chosen ctf-tools, extracts domains and strings, then proposes SafeLine rules and hosts entries. The operator reviews and accepts with a button.\n\n5) Java malware spike diagnosis: SafeLine flags odd outbound POSTs from a Java process. The system attaches lucko/spark briefly to capture stack and net hotspots, confirming a malicious HTTP client loop. Risk spikes, the process is quarantined (operator-confirmed), and IOCs are logged.\n\n6) Evidence packaging for reporting: With collected headers, IPs, and IOCs, the dashboard produces a time-ordered incident dossier (JSON and PDF) suitable for abuse desks or law enforcement. It includes reproducible steps using only local tools.\n\n7) Progressive rule hardening: As multiple incidents accumulate, the skfolio-driven factor weights surface which signals were most predictive for you (e.g., TLD types, timing patterns). The dashboard suggests incremental SafeLine rule patches tailored to your environment.\n\nScalability/extensibility:\n- Everything works offline once repos are pulled; analyses are local. On stronger machines, increase time caps for deeper Triton paths or broader jadx scans.\n- The design is additive: add new ctf-tools scripts without changing the core. SafeLine rules are composable. frp supports multiple decoy tunnels in parallel if you expand beyond a single PC.\n\nLimitations and mitigations:\n- Symbolic execution is inherently heavy; we cap it strictly and rely on static heuristics first. The operator can opt-in for deeper runs.\n- System-level modifications (hosts, proxy settings) require admin privileges; the installer includes clear rollback steps and a safe-mode profile.\n- Attribution to a human is not guaranteed; we frame “tracking down” as infrastructure attribution (IPs, ASNs, hosting, campaign linkage) and evidence quality, not personal identity. We provide abuse-report-ready outputs instead of vigilante actions.",
  "innovation_analysis": "Innovation score: 8.2/10. Repurposing a finance portfolio optimizer (skfolio) as a light, explainable risk fusion engine for endpoint security is an unusual but effective twist. Combining SafeLine’s WAF semantics with frp-controlled ephemeral honeypots on a single PC creates a compact defense-and-attribution loop rarely seen outside enterprise labs. Triton/jadx/ctf-tools bring serious analysis without cloud reliance.\n\nNext steps:\n- Milestone 1 (1–2 days): Stand up hackathon-starter dashboard (local only), integrate Bootstrap UI, add Evidence and Policy APIs, wire SafeLine as local proxy, and schedule hosts updates.\n- Milestone 2 (3–5 days): Implement frp controller, basic decoy service, log ingestion, and risk scoring prototype with skfolio.\n- Milestone 3 (1–2 weeks): Add analysis worker (Triton, jadx, selected ctf-tools), IOC-to-rule suggestions, and incident export.\n\nKey metrics:\n- Pre-click block rate; false-positive rate; median triage time; IOC yield (unique domains/IPs per artifact); decoy engagement rate; time-to-frp tunnel.\n\nEssential tools/frameworks (from repos): SafeLine (Go), frp (Go), hackathon-starter (Node/Express), Bootstrap, Triton (Python/C++), jadx (Java), ctf-tools (shell installers), skfolio (Python), StevenBlack/hosts (Python).",

A while later, you might have an initial project up on GitHub, and only then can other team members start contributing. Or how about doing something as simple as _Sign in with Facebook_ authentication? You can spend hours on it if you are not familiar with how OAuth 2.0 works.\n\nWhen I started this project, my primary focus was on **simplicity** and **ease of use**.\nI also tried to make it as **generic** and **reusable** as possible to cover most use cases of hackathon web apps, without being too specific. In the worst case, you can use this as a learning guide for your projects, if for example you are only interested in **Sign in with Google** authentication and nothing else.\n\n### Testimonials\n\n> [**\"Nice!

It typically protects web apps from attacks such as `SQL injection`, `XSS`, `code injection`, `os command injection`, `CRLF injection`, `ldap injection`, `xpath injection`, `RCE`, `XXE`, `SSRF`, `path traversal`, `backdoor`, `bruteforce`, `http-flood`, `bot abused`, among others.\n\n#### 💡 How It Works\n\n<img src=\"/images/how-it-works.png\" width=\"800\" />\n\nBy deploying a WAF in front of a web application, a shield is placed between the web application and the Internet. While a proxy server protects a client machine’s identity by using an intermediary, a WAF is a type of reverse-proxy, protecting the server from exposure by having clients pass through the WAF before reaching the server.\n\nA WAF protects your web apps by filtering, monitoring, and blocking any malicious HTTP/S traffic traveling to the web application, and prevents any unauthorized data from leaving the app. It does this by adhering to a set of policies that help determine what traffic is malicious and what traffic is safe. Just as a proxy server acts as an intermediary to protect the identity of a client, a WAF operates in similar fashion but acting as a reverse proxy int",

Sensors on Project Aria capture egocentric video and audio, in addition to eye-gaze, inertial, and location information. On-device compute power is used to encrypt and store information that, when uploaded to separate designated back-end storage, helps researchers build the capabilities necessary for AR to work in the real world.\n\n![Aria multi modal sensors preview](data/aria_sensors.jpg?raw=true \"Title\")\n\n\n### What's Aria Data Tools?\n\nAria Data Tools provides C++ and Python3 tools to interact with [Project Aria](https://about.facebook.com/realitylabs/projectaria/) data to:\n\n* Read and visualize Project Aria sequences and sensor data\n* Retrieve calibration data and interact with Aria camera models\n\n\n### What's the Aria Pilot Dataset?\n\nThe Aria Pilot Dataset provides data from a variety of egocentric scenarios, including cooking, exercising, playing games and spending time with friends.

The viewer can also apply deobfuscation mappings.\n\nIt works by sampling statistical data about the systems activity, and constructing a call graph based on this data. The call graph is then displayed in an online viewer for further analysis by the user.\n\nThere are two different profiler engines:\n* Native/Async - uses the [async-profiler](https://github.com/async-profiler/async-profiler) library (*only available on Linux & macOS systems*)\n* Java - uses `ThreadMXBean`, an improved version of the popular [WarmRoast profiler](https://github.com/sk89q/WarmRoast) by sk89q.\n\n### :zap: Memory Inspection\n\nspark includes a number of tools which are useful for",
